  title: More on the Quantum Double
  speaker: Ross Street
  date: 1996-07-31T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    This was a report on my recent preprint “The Quantum Double and Related Constructions”. Three monoidal constructions were discussed:

    1) a braided monoidal category Z(V) from any monoidal category V
    2) a balanced monoidal category V^Z from any braided monoidal category V
    3) a tortile monoidal category N(V) from any balanced monoidal category V

    The first two constructions already appear in our paper A.Joyal & R.Street, Tortile Yang-Baxter operators in tensor categories, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 71 (1991) 43-51. The last two are actually right adjoints to the forgetfuls.  The Representation Theorem from Section 7 of our paper A.Joyal & R.Street, An Introduction to Tannaka duality and quantum groups; Lecture Notes in Mathematics 1488 (Springer-Verlag, 1991) 411-492  was invoked to obtain three corresponding constructions for bialgebras:

    1) a cobraided bialgebra D_1(B) from any bialgebra B
    2) a cobalanced bialgebra D_2(B) from any cobraided bialgebra B
    3) a cotortile Hopf algebra D_3(B) from any cobalanced bialgebra B

    Cotortile Hopf algebras provide a good abstract notion of quantum group.
    Composing the three monoidal constructions we obtain a tortile monoidal category D(V) for each monoidal category V.  This agrees with the double described in C.Kassel & V.Turaev, Double Construction for Monoidal Categories, Acta Math. 175 (1995) 1-48 when V is left autonomous.  Composing the three bialgebra constructions, we obtain a quantum group D(B) for any bialgebra B.  This agrees with the Reshetikhin-Turaev ribbon algebra of the Drinfield double in the case where B is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra

  title: Categories of fractions and infinitary structures
  speaker: Steve Lack
  date: 1996-08-14T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    This talk was a gentle introduction to categories of fractions and coinverters, and conditions under which structure on a category passes to the category of fractions.  Most of the talk was taken up in a summary of left and right caculi of fractions (Gabriel-Zisman), pullback congruences (Bénabou) and the theorem of Kelly-Lack-Walters that for T a strongly-finitary  2-monad on Cat, the forgetful 2-functor from T-Alg to Cat creates reflexive coinverters.

    It was then noted that this can be extended to 2-monads involving operations of possibly infinite but still discrete arity, at the expense of making the assumption that the class Σ of arrows to be inverted admit a calculus of left or right fractions.

    [Joint work with Brian Day]

    [A little open problem about monoidal adjunctions was presented to start.]
    Last week (at the University of Sydney) I discussed the contravariant adjunction between V-opcategories and V-categories:
    each V-category C yields a V-opcategory C^(czech) and each V-opcategory A yields a V-category Comod_{f} A.

    This week I looked at refining this when C is monoidal and A is comonoidal (a one-object comonoidal V-opcategory is a bialgebra). This is further refined when C is autonomous (=3D rigid) and A is a “Hopf opalgebroid”.  The ideas of my old generalised Beck monadicity theorem from the paper  Two constructions on lax functors, Cahiers topologie et geometrie differentielle 13 (1972) 217-264  are applied.

  abstract: |-
    I consider in this talk the two dimensional case of the general definition of a weak ω-category (this definition was given in my talks on 14 August 1996 at Macquarie University )  My aim is to demonstrate that the weak 2-categories in the sense of this general definition are bicategories and conversely.

    For this I investigate thoroughly the structure of contractible 2-operads and prove the following lemma

    Lemma. The category of pointed contractible 2-operads is isomorphic to the category of  pointed nonsymmetric chaotic Cat-operads (where chaotic means that an operad consists of chaotic categories) and hence, to the category of pointed nonsymmetric Set-operads.

    This lemma allows to prove the following proposition.

    Proposition. Every algebra over  a contractible pointed 2-operad may be endowed with a canonical sructure of a bicategory. Conversely, every bicategory has a canonical structure over the universal pointed contractible 2-operad.

    The proof uses the coherence theorem for bicategories.

No, because union of commutative groups is not commutative in general.

    2. observing a group is a category with one object, recognize an element of the center as a natural transformation id → id. want to use this as basis for general definition of center.

    4. for k-monoidal ω-tas C, define its k-center by Z_k (C) = Ω^k (ω-Teisi (Sigma^k C, Sigma^k C)). Low dimensional elements are identity transformations, higher dimensional elements are transformations between those.
    5. compare this with known definition of center of a monoidal category, where an object of the center is a pair (A, R_A,-): canonical projection Z_k (C) → C by evaluation at the unique object of Sigma^k C, which explains the A, and q-transformation Sigma^k C tensor 2_q → Sigma^k C induces, via a quite complicated construction called ``localization of transformations', a q-transformation C tensor 2_q C, which explains the R_A,-. This gives description of elements of k-center of C as element of C + transformation.

  date: 1996-09-18T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Sydney
  abstract: |-
    This brief talk will be an exploration of some challenges, rather than a presentation of results.

    The ability to check the types of programs places some constraints on the power of the type system. Additional constraints arise if types are checked statically, i.e. during compilation of the program.

    If we model types as objects of a category, with programs as morphisms, then the constraints on typing do not allow us to assume the existence of all finite limits. Further, static typing is in conflict with extensivity, which already assumes the existence of a generous class of pullbacks. The problems arise when *assuming* the existence of finite limits.

    To anyone (like me) who has used lextensivity as a foundational tool in the study of computation (as opposed to specification), this is somewhat disturbing. I conjecture that the limits required for type analysis can be constructed without first assuming their existence.

  speaker: Michael Batanin
  date: 1996-10-23T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    The subject of this talk was a construction of some categorical base for the development of the theory of ω-operads and weak ω-categories. This work was motivated by the necessity to clarify the definition of weak ω-category and to have a possibility to develop a sort of “internal” weak ω-category theory.

    For this one can try to define a sort of natural environment where the further constructions will  be developed.  It turns out that an appropriate enviroment is the theory of monoidal globular categories.

    A  monoidal globular  category  is a sequence of categories together with source and target functors satisfying the same conditions as the wellknown source and target functions for  globular sets. We can also compose (in the sense of a $k$-th composition) a pair of objects if the $k$-source of one object coincides with $k$-target of another. There are also the functors which play the role of “weak units” for these compositions. The compositions must be “weakly associative” and “weakly interchangeable”. There are also the coherence laws for these isomorphisms. A globular monoidal category is said to be strict if all these isomorphisms are identities. We have also the constructions of  free monoidal and strict free monoidal categories.

    The  examples of monoidal glogular categories were given that include the strict ω-categories, bicategories, braided monoidal and symmetric monoidal categories. There is also a  monoidal globular category of generalized spans, which will play an important role in further development.

    A coherence theorem for monoidal globular categories and its applicatins to higher order weak category theory will be the subject of my talk on the next seminar.

  title: Coherence for monoidal globular categories
  speaker: Michael Batanin
  date: 1996-10-30T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Sydney
  abstract: |-
    In my previous talk I introduced a  notion of monoidal globular  category which is a sequence of categories together with source and target functors satisfying the same conditions as the wellknown source and target functions for  globular sets. We can also compose (in the sense of a $k$-th composition) a pair of objects if the $k$-source of one object coincides with $k$-target of another. There are also the functors which play the role of units for these compositions. The compositions must be `weakly associative' and `interchangeable`. There are also the coherence laws for these isomorphisms.

    A  monoidal globular category is said to be strict if all these isomorphisms are identities. I give in this talk  the constructions of  free monoidal  and strict free monoidal globular categories. For this I consider a special strict monoidal globular category $Tr$ called the category of multistage trees. I proved that the discretisation of $Tr$ is the free ω-category generated by one object, one enddomorphism of this object, one endomotphism of this endomorphism and so on. This discrete monoidal category will play a central role in the definition of weak ω-category.

    The coherence theorem is proved, which asserts that a natural strict monoidal functor from the free monoidal globular category generated by a globular category to the  free  strict monoidal globular category generated by this globular category is an equivalence. This theorem generalizes  MacLane's coherence theorem for monoidal and symmetric monoidal categories, and the coherence theorem for bicategories and for braided monoidal categories of Joyal-Street.  On the other hand it contains as a special case a sort of pasting theorem for $n$-categories. The applications of this theorem to the theory of weak ω-categories will be given in my next talk.

I then looked at the notion of duality for Hopf algebras given in Kassel: A (perfect) duality between Hopf algebras H and K is a (non-degenerate) bilinear form on H x K such that the induced maps H → K* and K → H* are both morphisms of algebras.

    recall that if B is a bialgebra, then the category Mod(B) is monoidal in such a way  that the forgetful functor U: Mod(B) –→ Vect preserves just about everything.  We shall show that the converse is also true.  that is,  if Mod(B) is monoidal in such a way that the forgetful functor preserves just about everything, then B is a bialgebra, and the monoidal structure is induced by the coalgebra structure on B.  the proof will involve many lovely string diagrams.

    we will then define the notions of quasicommutative bialgebras, and braided bialgebras.  we shall show that if B is a braided bialgebra, then Mod(B) is a braided monoidal category in such a way that the forgetful functor preserves just about everything. We remark that the converse is also true.  that is,  if Mod(B) is braided monoidal in such a way that the forgetful functor preserves just about everything, then B is a braided bialgebra, and the monoidal structure is induced by the braiding structure  on B.  the proof may be found in ross streets lecture notes on quantum groups.

  title: Higher order operads and their algebras from the point of view of the theory of monoidal globular categories
  speaker: Michael Batanin
  date: 1996-11-06T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    The  theory of monoidal globular categories gives me the necessary tools for defining  the notion of weak n-category.

    I call an ω-collection of spans a globular functor from the globular category of trees Tr to Span. The coherence theorem allows me to introduce, on the category of ω-collections, a sort of monoidal structure (in some weak sense). This monoidal structure generalizes a monoidal structures on the nonsymmetric collections used in the definition of the (nonsymmetric) operads.

    So I define an n-operad to be a monoid in the category of n-collections.

    One can also define  an n-operad  of endomorphisms generated by an ω-globular set (or more generally by a globular object ( i.e. a globular functor from U to C, where U is a terminal globular category) in a monoidal globular category C). Finally, a weak ω-category is an ω-globular set together with a map from a contractible (in a suitable sense) ω-operad to the operad of endomorphisms of this globular set.

    For example, the strict ω-category are the algebras of a terminal ω-operad. The weak 2-categories are exactly the bicategories and the category of contractible 2-operads is isomorphic to the category of non-symmetric chaotic Cat-operads (this means that we have in every dimension a category which is equivalent to one-object one-arrow category). There exists a universal ω-operad which acts on every weak n-category (including n=ω.) Recently, Clemens Berger suggested to me a construction of a contractible 3-operad whose algebras are Gray-categories.

    The theory of monoidal globular categories allows also the development of the theory of internal weak ω-category and cocategory objects that will be useful for the problem of modelling of homotopy types.

  title: One construction on lax functors
  speaker: Steve Lack
  date: 1996-11-13T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Sydney
  abstract: |-
    If T is a 2-monad on a 2-category K then one can define the 2-category T-Alg of (strict) algebras, pseudomorphisms, and algebra 2-cells for the 2-monad. It has a locally full sub-2-category T-Alg_s with the same objects but with only the strict morphisms as arrows. Provided, say, that K is locally presentable and T has a rank, the inclusion J of T-Alg_s in T-Alg is known to have a left adjoint, sometimes called ( )'. In this talk I give a construction of the left adjoint in terms of iso-coinserters and coequifiers in T-Alg_s; once again, these colimits in T-Alg_s are known to exist if K is locally presentable and T has a rank.

    A natural context for the above construction is that of a sufficiently cocomplete 2-category L (which takes the place of T-Alg_s) with a 2-comonad on it (taking the place of the comonad induced by the adjunction between T-Alg_s and K). In this generality one can produce a new comonad on L; forming the Kleisli object for this comonad recovers, in the case of the previous paragraph, the 2-category T-Alg.

    Dually one could start with a 2-monad on a sufficiently complete 2-category and produce a new 2-monad, and then consider its Kleisli object. In fact a 2-monad T is just a lax functor (of 3-categories) from 1 to 2-Cat, and this construction can be carried out on more general lax functors, whence the title of the talk. For those tickled by the idea of a second construction on lax functors, one can repeat the whole analysis considering the lax rather than the pseudo morphisms of algebras.

    Returning to the construction of ( )' in the first paragraph, one sees that every T-algebra which is flexible in the sense of Bird, Kelly, Power, Street, Flexible limits for 2-categories, JPAA 61 (1989), 1-27 is a flexible colimit in T-Alg_s of free algebras. In that same paper, the authors prove that a flexible colimit (in T-Alg_s) of free algebras is flexible, and so we have the result that the flexible algebras for a 2-monad are precisely the closure under flexible colimits in T-Alg_s of the free algebras.

    Finally I observed that this old result that flexible colimits of flexible algebras are flexible gives an elegant and general proof of the theorem of Crans-Kelly-Power (paper in preparation) that ``monads given by inductive presentations with no equations between objects are flexible'. In the C-K-P paper, various operations on monads are seen to preserve flexibility, and these operations can all be described as forming certain flexible colimits in the 2-category 2-Mnd(K) of 2-monads on K and strict maps of such.

    At the end of the talk, Michael Batanin pointed out some connections between the construction of ( )' and his paper Coherent categories with respect to monads and coherent prohomotopy theory, Cahiers de Topologie et Géometrie Différentielle, XXXIV-4(1993), 279-304.

  title: Fusion operators as generalised Hopf structures

  location: Sydney
  abstract: |-
    Since only one member of the audience admitted to having heard last year's talk on fusion operators, I reviewed my paper Fusion operators and cocycloids in monoidal categories (preprint, August 1995; submitted). A fusion operator  V : A(tensor)A -~→ A(tensor)A  on  A  gives rise to a 3-cocycle  v : A(tensor)A -~→ A(tensor)A  via  v = c V  where  c  is (at least) a braiding.  A 3-cocycle is a 4-simplex in the nerve of the ambient braided monoidal category regarded as a 1-object 1-arrow tricategory. They also appear in the expression of coherence for associativity constraint of a promonoidal category.  Each Hopf algebra  H  gives a fusion operator  V on  H  which is the composite of  (delta)(tensor)1  and  1(tensor)(mu). The unit and counit can be used to recapture the multiplication  mu, the comultiplication  delta,  and the antipode  (nu).  This is the point of the talk's title. Ideas of Tannaka duality can be used to obtain a Hopf algebra from the monoidal category of modules over a tricocycloid (= object equipped with a 3-cocycle).

    I gave what I believe to be generators and relations for the free braided monoidal category on a single generating object bearing a tricocycloid structure. It would be nice to have a geometric model and/or something like a faithful representation by free group automorphisms as we do for the Baez-Birman singular (or welded) braids which are relevant to Vassiliev invariants for knots.

  abstract: |-
    The talk began with some philosophical remarks on the need to more publicly present unified views of higher dimensional categorical notions, i.e., to "present the mathematics of definitions" rather than just the definitions.  By way of example the talk provided a unified treatment of, inter alia, functors, natural transformations, 2-natural transformations, lax natural transformations, modifications, and lax modifications.

    We explored the slogan "View category theory as directed, globular, homologiical algebra plus functoriality".  It turns out that using just three concepts – homotopy of maps of complexes (of arbitrary degree), functoriality of chain maps, and the mapping cone of chain maps – we recover/discover the details of all of the notions mentioned above, and obtain proposals for the definitions of their higher dimensional analogues.

Recalled "one-dimensional" Zamolodchikov operator and system, and waved my hands a bit about pulling strings to prove the lemma that in a braided monoidal category the braiding gives a 1-dim Zam system.    In a braided monoidal 2-category the two proofs of YB turn into two cells which are required to be equal: "S+ = S-". The data for a "two-dimensional" Zam system are 1-dim R's and 2-dim S's filling YB hexagons.    To formulate Zam equation, look at how R and S operate on four factors; it turns out that the equation states that the two sides of the 3-dimensional permutohedron are equal.    By investigating

    —   —   —   —  /   \ /   \ /   \ /   \ .  D  .  C  .  B  .  A  .  \   / \   / \   / \   /   —   —   —   —

    in an ω-tas with one arrow, get a clear and complete picture: in a braided monoidal 2-category the braiding is a Zam system, by taking S either one of the fillings of the YB hexagon (which are equal anyway), there are three different proofs of the Zam equation, which in a braided monoidal Gray-category turn into cells, and it follows from the axioms for ω-teisi that these cells are equal.    It would also be possible to do things slightly weaker, by having a cell between S+ and S-, and elsewhere, and then there are five different proofs of Zam which again turn into cells. Careful analysis gives a beautiful five-dimensional diagram relating these 3-dim cells.    I gave the decompositions of the permutohedron for the different proofs; the decompositions are the same as Kapranov and Voevodsky give, except that 3 of their 8 don't give a legitimate proof (to wit: only a+++ = +++a, —a = a— and ++-- = --++ are legitimate).    It is now straightforward to define a three-dimensional Zam system as R's, S's and 3-dim T's filling the permutohedron; the 3-dim Zam equation can be summarized by

    —   —   —   —   —  /   \ /   \ /   \ /   \ /   \ .  E  .  D  .  C  .  B  .  A  .   ,  \   / \   / \   / \   / \   /   —   —   —   —   —

    and it is trivial that the braiding in a braided 4-dim tas gives rise to a 3-dim Zam system by taking T to be any filling corresponding to a proof of the 2-dim Zam equation (which are equal anyway). This continues in higher dimensions, and also slightly weaker.    Can also generalize Yang-Baxter by investigating

    —--   —--   —--  / / \ \ / / \ \ / / \ \ . | C | . | B | . | A | .  \ \ / / \ \ / / \ \ / /   —--   —--   —--

    in a sylleptic 4-dim tas, and the syllepsis gives rise to a 4-dim YB system. This also continues in higher dimensions.

  title: The free T-category on a T-graph
  speaker: Steve Lack
  date: 1996-11-27T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Sydney
  abstract: |-
    This talk was inspired by the paper R.F.C.Walters, The free category with products on a multigraph, JPAA 62(1989), 205-210. I proposed an answer to the question ``If products are replaced by some other structure borne by a category, what should replace multigraphs?' I consider a 2-monad T on Cat, and call a category with a T-algebra structure a T-category. Writing Cat^T for the 2-category of T-categories and morphisms strictly preserving this structure, and Cat//T for the ``double comma category' whose objects are pairs of maps d,c:E→TV in Cat; I then define a 2-functor from Cat^T to Cat//T, and show that it has a left adjoint if T has a rank. This 2-category Cat//T should be seen as replacing Cat(Mgph) used by Walters; and a T-graph is defined to be an object of Cat//T for which E and V are discrete.

    Various extensions were discussed: dealing with non-strict maps, dealing with the non-monadic case, and replacing Cat by an arbitrary locally presentable 2-category.

    These T-graphs seems to be the ``correct notion' in various particular examples, but are difficult to motivate in the generality described above. There seems to be a connection, not yet well understood, with the paper Connected limits, familial representability and Artin gluing of Carboni and Johnstone. The definitions made in this talk seem a reasonable start to the problem, but there is clearly much still to be understood.

    This was a talk on elementary category theory. By examining and slightly extending a little-known result of John Isbell appearing in ["Structure of categories" Bull. AMS 72 (1966) 619-655], we deduced a well-known result of Bob Paré and discussed an unpublished (I think) result of Peter Freyd. The main result was that, if we have functors

    i : A → X,  r : X → A,

    a natural transformation  eta : 1 → r i, and, if idempotents split in  A, then  A  has a terminal object provided  X  does.  Notice that  eta  does not need to be invertible.  This gives the usual results about transfer of limits and colimits to a full reflective subcategory. It also gives the result of Paré that only one of the adjunction triangles implies the construction of an adjoint via splitting an idempotent. The result of Freyd was the Most (?) General Adjoint Functor Theorem involving "uniform continuity" of a functor.

Indeed, the lovely preprint Julien Bichon, "Trivialisations dans les categories tannakiennes" (Prepublication 1996/14, Dept des Sciences Math, Universite Montpellier II) significantly advances our knowledge of the area.

    The talk was about the second half of Chapter 3 of my PhD thesis, but with the emphasis on lax-q-transformations and their composition. In particular, I described Michael Johnson's pasting theorem, how, using this, the conditions for a lax-q-transformation can be formulated in terms of realizations of tensor products of globes with globes or with two joined globes, and I gave the mu-composition of lax-q-transformations in terms of triple tensor products of globes.

    The point is that this composition is dimension-raising in such a way that ω-categories and lax-q-transformations are a, even the, prototypic weak interchange category as Mike was after last week.

    Working in the context of a general prototypic weak interchange 3-category (like a Gray-category except there is only a ``lax' rather than a ``pseudo' middle-four-interchange law) we defined lax monads, lax algebras, lax morphisms and so on, giving a general framework for understanding the relevant coherence conditions.

  title: On coherent situations
  speaker: Sjoerd Crans
  date: 1997-02-19T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Michael Johnson has been claiming recently that he understands the coherence conditions for associativities and identities. In order to verify that claim, I went through Chapter 4 of his PhD thesis (which is as yet unavailable).

    (Internal) coherence is about commutativity of formal diagrams of natural transformations, Mike uses pasting schemes to describe coherent situations.   Example: coherence for multiplication m which is associative up to an associator a, pentagon.   A situation consists of a collection of k-dimensional pasting schemes (thought of as ways of multiplying n things) and a collection of singleton (k+1)-dimensional pasting schemes (the things for which one wants to establish coherence), together with a realization, satisfying conditions. The situation is coherent if all (k+1)-dimensional composites with same domain and codomain are equal ("all diagrams of a's commute").   To make the example into a situation, take 2-dimensional simplicial sets and singleton 3-dimensional simplicial sets. One needs a realization of these in an ω-category, which is taken to be: one object, arrows natural numbers, 2-cells functors Kn → Km, 3-cells natural transformations, with realization: triangles sent to m, tetrahedra to a.   To prove that all diagrams commute from commutativity of the pentagon, and more generally, to get sufficient conditions for coherence, Mike uses commuting completions of forks, and the well-known no overlap argument.

    How useful is this theory of coherence in relation to weak n-categories?

    (Weakly) monoidal n-categories goes via (n+1)-dimensional simplicial sets, as Mike shows.   For Gray-categories with a multiplication K tensor K → K, the canonical things are pseudo-natural transformations, and the thing to realize in is not an n-category, but some Gray-version of these. If the pasting theorem can be extended to these sort of higher-dimensional categories, then this theory of coherence extends to this situation too.   For bicategories can just take the ω-category to have more objects and arrows strings of objects, etc., and coherence of the associativity of composition can be dealt with as before.   For tricategories, 0-composition is a homomorphism of bicategories, which is too weak for the present set-up. So need coherence locally and of homomorphisms before can do coherence of 0-composition. This inductive approach is the same as in GPS's "Coherence for tricategories".   Making the identities of the same shape as the multiplication only works in a higher-dimensional category which itself has strict identities.

    Conclusion: Mike's approach to associativities and identities has the potential to go quite a long way. What it certainly can not do is relate associativities and identities in more than one dimension at once.

    This talk was based on the the articles Sketches and Computation I & II by Dominique Duval and Jean-Claude Reynaud, in Mathematical Structures in Computer Science, 1994. It was given in response to Richard Buckland's comments the previous week about ``angelic non-determinism'.

    Duval and Reynaud introduce notions of graph, category, functor, sketch, distributive category, and so on appropriate for the world of locally bidiscrete bicategories. Their sketches have are not necessarily projective, but all designated cones and cocones are required to be finite and discrete (i.e. they amount to product and coproduct specifications in the models.)

    They define the terms and expressions of a sketch; the expressions are to be thought of as programs over the sketch, and the terms as possible values of programs. The terms of a projective sketch are shown to constitute an initial model of the sketch. More generally, a (not neccesarily projective) sketch for which the terms constitute an inital model is said to be quasi-projective . In this case every expression is equivalent to some term. Static evaluation is a process of finding a term equivalent to a given expression.

    For sketches which are not quasi-projective, one is forced to use dynamic evaluation: given an expression one begins to evaluate it, and as soon as a branch occurs in the program which cannot be resolved, one splits the sketch, by making two (or more) enrichments of the sketch, and then evaluating simultaneously in the various sketches.

  title: On braided monoidal categories and double loop spaces
  speaker: Clemens Berger
  date: 1997-03-05T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    I first introduced the little squares operad of Boardman-Vogt and mentionned that an operad-action of the little squares on a topological space X induced a double delooping of X. The geometric idea behind this is the realization of the little squares as a subspace of the space of pointed maps of the 2-sphere into a bunch of 2-spheres.

    Then I outlined a proof of Fiedorowicz's theorem that the geometric realization of a braided monoidal category admits a double delooping. By Joyal-Street's Coherence Theorem for braided monoidal categories there is actually a categorical non-$\Sigma$-operad action of the weak Bruhat orders on each (lax) braided (strict) monoidal category. After taking nerves, this operad-action extends canonically to a simplicial $\Sigma$-operad-action. The proof that this simplicial operad is equivalent to the little squares operad depends on a canonically defined filtration of the standard simplicial $E_\infty$-operad.

    I finally discussed a categorical double delooping construction which assigns to a braided monoidal category a lax 3-category (i.e. a category enriched over the category of 2-categories with its closed structure given by Gray's tensor product). The assignment is just shifting up dimension twice, the braidings transform into Gray composition.

    The nerve of a lax 3-category is defined by means of a cosimplicial object in the category of lax 3-categories whose strictification gives exactly Street's (3-categorical) orientals. The 2-category between initial and terminal object of the lax n-th oriental is a 2-categorical (n-1)-cube, whose 2-cells have an interpretation in terms of the weak Bruhat orders. Gray composition induces geometrically the cartesian product of cubes.

  abstract: 'In a joint work of J. Rosicky, F. Borceux and J. Adamek, full subcategories of locally presentable categories are characterized, which can be presented by injectivity with respect to a set  M  of morphisms. If all domains and codomains of M-morphisms are k-presentable, such full subcategories are called k-injectivity classes. The characterization is as follows: If  K  is a locally k-presentable category,then k-injectivity classes are precisely the classes closed under products, split subobjects and k-filtered colimits in  K. This sharpens the previous result (published by J. Adamek and J. Rosicky in 1993 in the Transactions of AMS) characterizing small-injectivity classes in locally presentable categories as classes closed under products, split subobjects and,for some cardinal  k  ,under k-filtered colimits. The latter theorem has been recently generalized by H.Hu and M.Makkai to a characterization of small-cone-injectivity classes as classes closed under split subobjects and, for some cardinal  k, under k-filtered colimits. We show that this last result cannot be sharpened in the above manner. This leaves the following question open: Characterize, for a given cardinal  k, classes of structures axiomatizable by geometric theories. in k-ary logic.'

    This was a brief report on three conferences I have just returned from:     Northwestern University Algebraic Topology Conference,  23-27 March 1997 (in honour of Prof M. Mahowald)     Workshop on Higher Category Theory and Physics, 28-30 March 1997 (Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, Organizers: E. Getzler, M. Kapranov)     Memorial Conference for Garrett Birkhoff, 1 April 1997 (Jefferson Building Room 250, Harvard University, Oxford St, Cambridge, MA)

    In very brief summary, I found that:    categories are well used in a wide range of mathematical activities;    operads are experiencing an exciting resurgence;  and    the demand for the development of higher dimensional categories is coming from many fronts outside category theory.

    In relation to (c), John Baez gives a case for higher categories in field theory. Other speakers at Conference #II gave other needs from physics. The needs of knot theory, homotopy theory, algebraic geometry, cohomology theory, etc were well articulated.

    Good problems bring, with their solutions, more widely applicable techniques. The problem of defining weak n-categories has stimulated two magnificent ideas which I believe will be vastly more applicable than to the problem for which they were devised. These are:    (Baez-Dolan) the "plus construction on typed operads";    (Batanin) the ω-category of trees and the globular set  T*  of a tree  T.

  location: Sydney
  abstract: |-
    This was a report on joint work with Max Kelly; a preprint will very soon be available.

    The purpose of the talk was to describe certain differences between two 2-monads on Cat: the one whose algebras are monoidal categories, and the one whose algebras are categories with finite coproducts. Whereas for the first, a given category can have many algebra structures; for the second such structure is ``essentially unique' if it exists. Whereas for the first, a functor between monoidal categories can have many structures of monoidal functor; for the second, a functor between categories with finite coproducts either preserves finite coproducts (in the usual sense) or does not. Thirdly any functor between categories with finite coproducts has exactly one structure of lax morphism of categories with finite coprodcuts; this is not at all the case for functors between monoidal categories.

    We propose a general framework in which to state conditions involving existence and/or uniqueness of T-algebra or T-morphism structure for a 2-monad T on a 2-category K. We call such a 2-monad property-like if  algebra structure is essentially unique and morphism structure is unique; this is in fact equivalent to essential uniqueness of ``generalized algebra structure', by which we mean an action of T not an object of K but on a 2-functor with codomain K. We call such a 2-monad lax-idempotent if every arrow between T-algebras admits a unique structure of lax T-morphism; the lax-idempotent 2-monads turn out to be precisely those 2-monads (T,m,i) for which m is left adjoint to iT with the counit being an identity. These are the strict version of the doctrines studied by Kock, Zoberlein, and others, and provide a very good ``lax' version of the notion of idempotent monad.

  abstract: |-
    We all know what natural transformations are. I gave a slightly different viewpoint: the commutativity condition is a higher-dimensional cell which happens to be an identity. In higher dimensions this leads to the notion of transfor, and to the important distinction between naturality and functoriality: the former is a cell relating composites in D, and the latter is an axiom on how composition in C relates to composition in D. Transfors should be composable, leading to an ω-tas Hom(C,D), and to an ω-tas ω-Teisi. There are interesting, unsolved, conceptual problems in this, though.

    I briefly hinted at localizations of transfors: a q-transfor r: C → D gives rise to a q-transfor C(c,c') → something which is almost, but not quite, D(r(c),r(c')).

    This talk was based on sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.3 of the forthcoming 100+ page paper Central observations on ω-teisi.

Furthermore, via a mild generalization of Penrose's string diagrams, a geometry is associated to E(N), this   being essentially the same geometry as that usually associated to the net N.

    The first half of the talk I explained the mechanics of horizontal composition in ω-teisi.

    In the second half, I explored quasi-functors of two variables in terms of transfors, the corresponding tensor product, and the extent to which this might fail to give a monoidal biclosed structure. Because the conditions for composition in an ω-tas are exactly the same as the conditions for a quasi-functors of two variables, composition is a functor C tensor C → C, and composition with a fixed q-cell is a q-transfor. Combining this with the interpretation of tensor as (-1)-composition, one gets that tensors are transfors.

  title: Finite coproducts in variable categories
  speaker: Ross Street
  date: 1997-05-14T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: 'When we move away from ordinary category theory to enriched or variable category theory, it is no longer obvious what is the most useful replacement for "finite coproducts". In the enriched case, where the base category V is monoidally locally finitely presentable, I proposed that tensors x#a with finitely presented objects x in V should be included along with the more obvious finite coproducts a_1 + . . . + a_n. My reason for going back to such basics was to try to understand how Michael Batanin''s trees (or forests) could be regarded as natural numbers in the context of globular sets. I tried to convince the 17 members (including myself) of the Seminar that suspension of globular sets is a "finite copower" (as you might expect from our experience with chain complexes). I explained why the globular category of higher spans was the globular category of sets. Why is the bicategory structure on ordinary spans in Set intrinsic to the category of graphs? If we could understand this, we could try to intrinsically understand the monoidal structure (in Batanin''s sense) on the globular category of higher spans. A graphical (new?) view of distributors (profunctors) was presented: but why is composition intrinsic?'

  title: Finitary monads on globular sets and notions of computad they generate
  speaker: Michael Batanin
  date: 1997-05-21T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Sydney
  abstract: |-
    The pasting operation in the theory of strict n-categories is well understood, but  the corresponding operation in weak categories is not. This is my attempt to initiate this investigation.

    I prove that every finitary monad A on the category of globular sets generates an appropriate  category of n-computads (for every integer n). If we denote by A(n) the "n-skeleton" of A (this is a monad on the category of n-globular sets) then we have an forgetful functor from the category of A(n)-algebras to the category of n-computads; moreover, this functor has a left adjoint (the construction of the free A(n)-algebra generated by an n-computad is interesting by itself as it uses machinery applicable in many different situations). The counit of this adjunction may be considered as a generalized pasting operation for A(n)-algebras.

    As examples I consider the following monads on globular sets:    The monad D_s whose algebras are ω-categories. It generates the ordinary notion of n-computad and the usual pasting operation in n-categories.    The monad B on 2-globular sets the algebras of which are bicategories. The corresponding notion of 2-computad is considered. The pasting theorem in this case asserts that the result of pasting  of a 2-dimensional diagram depends only on a bracketing of 1-dimensional skeleton of it (so this is an another proof of a Dominic Verity result).    The monad G on 3-globular sets whose algebras are Gray-categories. The corresponding notion of 3-computad is Gray-computad that M.McIntyre and T.Trimble used in their calculus of progressive 3D-diagrams.

  abstract: |-
    For a small category C, I exhibited monoidal right-closed structures on the following categories   [C^op x C, Set]   [m(C)^op x C, Set]   [sm(C)^op x C, Set]   [fl(C)^op x C, Set]    where m(C) is the free monoidal category on C, where sm(C) is the free symmetric monoidal category, and fl(C) the free category with finite limits. In each case, considering monoids in the monoidal category in question gives a notion of operad. Case (3) gives precisely the C-operads of Baez-Dolan (see their paper Higher-Dimensional Algebra III: n-dimensional categories and the algebra of opetopes, while case (2) gives those C-operads which they call planar (or non-permutative). Case (1) gives monads on [C,Set] which have a right adjoint, and case (4) gives finitary monads on [C,Set].

    In each case (except maybe (2), which I haven't checked properly) one can imitate the ``plus-construction' of Baez-Dolan; given an operad M and an algebra A for the operad, it exhibits M-algebras over A as algebras for another operad called A+.

    The next step is to exhibit C-operads as algebras for some other operad, and carry out the ``plus-construction' on this latter operad. Baez and Dolan also want to carry out this process for operads in a restricted sense in which C is required to be discrete; it was precisely in order to repeat this for the case of finitary monads (i.e. for the operads of case (4) above) that I came to prove the results in my talk On the monadicity of finitary monads.

    We consider category theory enriched in a locally finitely presentable symmetric monoidal closed category V. We define V-filtered colimits to be those colimits weighted by a V-flat presheaf and consider the corresponding notion of V-accessible category. We prove that the V-accessible categories coincide with the categories of V-flat presheaves, and also with the categories of V-points of categories of V-presheaves. The V-locally presentable categories are exactly the V-cocomplete accessible ones.

    We define V-sketches and we prove that the V-accessible categories are, exactly, the categories of models of a V-sketch.

  title: Pasting potpourri
  speaker: Sjoerd Crans
  date: 1997-06-25T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    The basis for the mix was a look at John Power's 4-dimensional counter example, a pasting which is neither a pasting scheme, a 4-pasting scheme, a parity complex nor a directed complex. I described its geometrical structure, which is based on an Escher staircase, and its combinatorial structure, which shows that the possibility of changing the order of composition of the 3-dimensional intersection of the pasting is the main culprit.

    Question: is this counter example a Buckland scheme? I.e., is the paste a legitimate one?

    First solution for the counter example: pasting presentations, as in Chapter 2 of my PhD thesis "On combinatorial models for higher-dimensional homotopies". The possibility of inserting identities makes that the pasting can be done without introducing any loops.

    Second solution: 4-dimensional teisi. 3-dimensional teisi are Gray-categories, which differ from 3-categories in that horizontal composition of 2-cells is not definable in terms of vertical composition, but that there is a comparison-3-cell between the (two) possibilities. Using similar comparison-cells in dimension 4, the loop in the counter example disappears.

    It would be nice if there were a way of codifying this order-of-composition information in the notion of scheme. This leads to the (vague) idea of pswr, pronounced "psoor", which are supposed to be pasting schemes with extra order relations between the cells telling in which order they are to be (vertically) composed, with the absence of such relation indicating the higher-dimensional comparison cell.

  abstract: |-
    I described an explicit construction of the left biadjoint to the inclusion in the 2-category of distributive categories of the full sub-2-category comprising those distributive categories which are in fact extensive. Given a distributive category A, an object of the extensive reflection of A is an arrow a:A→1+1 of A, and an arrow from a:A→1+1 to b:B→1+1 is an arrow f:A→B+1 of A satisfying a certain condition. The details are in my thesis The algebra of distributive and extensive categories.

    The description is quite simple, but not particularly conceptual, and I then gave the beginnings of an attempt to give a more conceptual explanation; this lead to a discussion of the so-called ``strong' monads.

  abstract: |-
    Let L be the k-vector space of all linearly recursive  sequences over k. In this semianar we define two  multiplications, convolution and quantum convolution  on L, and show that this makes L into  an algebra. The results were shown in [1].

    We prove the results by constructing the  right adjoints to the functors               [-,k] : k-Coalg  → (k-Alg)^op           [-,k] : Comon(Mod(H)) → (Mon(Mod(H)))^op

    Where H is a Braided Hopf k-Algebra with invertible  antipode.  Usually these are called  "Ring" and denoted by a superscripted circle.      The new reserch in this seminar is the following:      Let V be a closed braided monoidal category.  Then  there exists a monoidal 2-functor                [-,I] : V^oprev → V      thus there exists an induced 2-functor                [-,I] : Comon(V^rev) → Mon(V)^op        We say that V has Algebra-Coalgebra Duality   if there exists a right 2-adjoint to this functor.   An examples of such  a V is Modules over a commutative   ring. Then Main result is that if V has Algebra-Coalgebra   Duality, then so does Mod(H), where H is a braided   hopf Monoid in V with invertible antipode.        It is also claimed (but not yet proven!) that these   results extend appropriately with Mon(V) and Comon(V)   replaced by V-Cat and V^op-Cat.

  abstract: |-
    In John Power's paper A general coherence result, JPAA 57(1989):165-173 it is proved that for a 2-monad T on Cat which preserve bijections on objects, every pseudo-T-algebra is equivalent to a strict T-algebra in the 2-category Ps-T-Alg of pseudo-T-algebras, (pseudo) T-morphisms, and T-transformations.

    Here we strengthen this result, showing that the inclusion in Ps-T-Alg of its sub-2-category T-Alg_s comprising only the strict T-algebras and the strict T-morphisms has a left (2-)adjoint, and that the unit of this adjunction is an equivalence.

    In fact for any 2-monad T on a cocomplete 2-category K, this adjunction exists if T is accessible (or has a rank), and we propose that ``the cohenrence theorem for T-algebras' should mean that the unit of this adjunction is an equivalence. It is still not clear in what generality this theorem might be expected to hold.

  abstract: |-
    In my previous talk, Max reminded me that there are precisely two monoidal biclosed structures on Cat: the cartesian product, and what Ross calls the "funny" tensor product. Enriching over these gives 2-categories and sesqui- categories respectively. One can envisage a generalization of this to higher dimensions, with more monoidal structures, e.g. Gray's tensor product of 2-categories, and with more ways of enriching, e.g. some sort of "weak" enrichment, e.g. one which should give bicategories and tricategories when enriched.
    This led to the following tentative heuristic hypothetical diagram of higher-dimensional categorical structures, where the lines indicate enriching over possible tensor products:                                                        Sets                                                       |                                   --                 Cat     -   --                                  /                    |   \   \    \                      -   Sesqui-Cat       --       2-Cat           Bicat                     /    / |             /            |          /  |      \                  .            -      3-Cat       Gray-Cat               Tricat                /             /    /    |  \     /     |   \           /   |   \              .                  .                     .                          .            /                  /                       |                            \ proto-Teisi/NIC   . . .   ω-Cat    . . .    ω-Teisi      . . . .        weak-ω-Cat   The following small parts of this diagram have hitherto be considered: up to sesqui-categories, the whole line to ω-categories, and the Gray-tensor on it (see Chapter 3 of my PhD thesis), up to 4D teisi (with the results in this series of talks), and the named structures in the right hand line of the diagram.

    I proved that the tensor product of Gray-categories defined a couple of talks ago is associative, via a presentation for the triple tensor. See sections 6 and 7 of the paper "A tensor product for Gray-categories".

    Re: Max' question whether proto-teisi/no-interchange categories can be defined in terms of a higher-dimensional version of the "funny" tensor product on Cat:
    define a no-interchange category as globular set C together with "vertical" compositions, where the dimension of the intersection of the elements to be composed is exactly one less than the dimension of the elements, and "whiskerings", where one of the elements is of higher dimension, subject to the usual axioms.
    Define a tensor product of NIC's by having as generators pairs (c,d) with one of these 0-dimensional, and relations coming from composition in each variable. Multiple tensor has generators (c_1, ..., c_k) with at most one of these not 0-dimensional.
    Note that the internal hom for this tensor product has as elements maps of degree k without any naturality condition.
    Theorem: a NIC-enriched category is a no-interchange category.

    Re: Giulio's question on whether double categories can be fitted in the current set-up:
    Given two categories C and D there is an obvious double category which is C horizontally, D vertically, and has squares pairs (f,g) with obvious faces and compositions. The 2-category associated to this double category is precisely the Gray-tensor of C and D (viewed as 2-categories).
    Given two 2-categories C and D there is, similarly, an obvious quadruple category. But there is only a 4- (and by reflection a 3-)category associated to this, not a Gray-category, because multiple categories have a strict interchange law.

Thus we consider  the 2-category V^op-Cat to be a generalization of the  category of k-Coalgbras.     Let V-Act denote the 2-Category of V-Actegories.  This  is simply the 2-category  T-psAlg for the pseudomonad  T= V x - : Cat → Cat.  Thus an object of V-Act is  a category A equipped with an action V x A → A,  which is associative and unital up to coherent isomorhism.      Let V-Act//V denote the 2-Category whose objects are triples,  (A, U : X → V-Act(A,V)), where A is a V-Actegory,  X is a set and U is a function.  Thus we may consider  V-Act//V to have objects A in V-Act equipped with  a family a "underlying" functors into V.      We define a 2-functor                Comod : (V^op-Cat)^op → V-Act//V      which agrees with the usual definition if Comod  when restricted to the one object V-Actegories (= coalgebras).  That is, if C is acoalgebra, then Comod(C) is the  usual category of representations together with  its underlynig functor into V.      We prove that Comod is 2-fully faithful, and that there  exists a partially defined right 2-adjoint.  thus the question arises:  "which objects in V-Act//V are equivalent to objects  of the form Comod(C), for some V^op-Category C."      In this seminar, we prove that the objects in V-Act//V  that are equivalent to objects of the form Comod(C) are  precisely those objects for which the family of functors  ((U_x:A→V)_(x in X)) are comonadic in the sense of  Street: 2-constructions on Lax functors.      there are intimate connections of this theorem  with Lawvere et als "structure and semantics."  these connections have since been clarified.

  title: Two ways to make a braiding into a transfor
  speaker: Sjoerd Crans
  date: 1998-01-07T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Setting: the setting is of semistrict higher-dimensional algebra. In dimension 3 this means Gray-categories, in dimension 4 this means 4-dimensional teisi, defined as (Gray-Cat)-categories, for the monoidal structure on Gray-Cat as in "A tensor product for Gray-categories".
    A q-transfor is a functor C tensor 2_q → D.
    A k-monoidal (n-dimensional) tas is a ((k+n)-dimensional) tas with one (k-1)-arrow (and hence with one i-arrow for every i  Sigma (C). Fixing an object A of C gives a transfor R_{A,-}: Sigma (C) tensor 2_1 → Sigma (C). I indicated how, for braided 2-categories, this induces a transfor A tensor - → - tensor A: C → C. Similarly, an arrow f of C gives a 2-transfor R_{f,-}: Sigma (C) tensor 2_2 → Sigma (C), which again induces a 2-transfor C tensor 2_1 → C. There are problems in generalizing this to braidings on higher-dimensional teisi, however.

    Another way: by definition, a braiding is a functor R: Sigma (C) tensor Sigma (C) → Sigma (C). Does it induce a transfor C tensor C → C? It does for braided 2-categories, but not trivially. In higher dimensions, the question becomes whether there is a canonical relation between Ω (2_p tensor 2_q) (where Ω should be some extension of the above Ω to diagrams) and 2_{p-1} tensor 2_{q-1} tensor 2_1, which seems to me an interesting question in its own, topological, right.

    Conclusion: the usual definition of a braiding (e.g. as in Generalized centers of braided and sylleptic monoidal 2-categories) indeed corresponds to the definition from the teisi point of view. However, the latter definition should be regarded as more fundamental, and is indicated in higher dimensions.

Undecided about whether braiding is equivalence or iso.    A few words about generalized 2-graphs. Progressiveness will mean we will only have planes, edges and nodes.    Progressive polarized boxed anchored 2-graphs: embed in 4D box, with outer edges and nodes on appropriate faces.    Free braided monoidal 2-categories on what? Not on 2-computads, as that cannot be represented for computational purposes, but on ``2-tensor 2-schemes'''', which involve words of words (Ross suggested ``braided rewrite systems'''').    Objects of free are deformation classes of points on line, where one can deform as long as no singularities are introduced. Arrows are deformation classes of string diagrams without singularities, where a singularity is, e.g., a node on top of a crossing, or a triple crossing. 2-arrows are deformation classes of progressive polarized boxed anchored 2-graphs, which I interpreted as movies of string diagrams where some (i.e., a finite number) of the frames may have one singularity. Deformations of these may have at most two singularities, or one singularity of degree 2, e.g., a quadruple crossing.    More in a future talk.'

  title: Operads without numbers
  speaker: Ross Street
  date: 1998-03-11T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Sydney
  abstract: |-
    I want a conceptual machine which, when you input a decent category E, outputs a mathematical structure  M(E).  Input  Set  and you should get "monoid".  Input the category of globular sets and you should get "ω-category".

    For this purpose, the mathematical structure  M(E)  can be identified with an endofunctor of (monad on)  E.  When the machine is applied to the category  Set,  the endofunctor should be "words in" (that is,  t(x) = the set of words in the alphabet  x).  When the category is globular sets, the endofunctor should be "trees labelled in" (that is, Batanin's functor  D_s).

    We review characterizations of the subcategories of  End(Set) equivalent to the categories of (i) sequences of sets, (ii) set-based clubs, (iii) Joyal species, (iv) Lawvere theories.  Note that "words in" corresponds to a terminal object of (i).  Motivated by this, we define analytic endofunctors on  E  relative to a given endofunctor  h : E → E. We show that, if  h  is parametrically representable then so is any analytic endofunctor relative to it.  We can then reproduce the characterizations (i) - (iv) for decent  E.

    Our desired machine takes M(E) to be the terminal object of the type (i) subcategory of  End(E).

    Operads can be identified with monads in categories of analytic endofunctors. Our machine gives us a way of obtaining operads directly. Natural numbers, trees, etc, can be obtained later as the value of the endofunctor  M(E)  at the terminal object  1  of  E.

In application to the free operad monad this gives a presentation of every n-operad which consists of an n-computad (in this generelized sense) and a relation on the free operad generated by this computad. We also give examples of such presentation.

  abstract: |-
    The rapid increase in integration level of electronic products, and the  emergence of the hardware and  software intellectual property marketplace, is focusing attention on  significant gaps in the methodology and technology for integrating  complex systems and chipsets. In this talk we outline a new approach,  based on a formal representation of behaviours as relations, to  the generation of interfaces connecting independent hardware blocks.  To relate the system-level behaviour to the  behaviours of encapsulated components, we model and relate behaviours at  different levels of abstraction.

    We base our presentation on a small, but revealing, case-study;  starting from a high-level specification, we design a digital  stopclock. The stopclock is specified and designed in terms of user-level  time ticks, and is implemented in terms of a much faster system-level  clock. A block diagram of the design is formalised at the abstract  level. Abstractions are introduced to relate this to the low-level  implementation. The interface logic, necessary to connect components  using different abstractions, is formally derived.

    We are working to automate this process to provide automated interface  synthesis for system integration.

  title: Z tensor product for (Gray-Cat)_tensor-categories
  speaker: Sjoerd Crans
  date: 1998-03-25T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Sydney
  abstract: |-
    First, Y tensor product? For the stricter counterpart of weak n-categories, which will be useful for proving things, via the ``Kelly-approach', and for computation. Also for the classification of homotopy n-types; even if iso-(Gray-Cat_tensor)-categories don't classify 4-types, what do they classify then?

    The basic principles for higher dimensional Gray-categorical structures are: horizontal composition is dimension raising, governed by the topological product of globes, axioms will be functoriality and associativity, labeled by ``elementary' pasting schemes (or, equivalently, trees), heuristically axiom equates ``most economical decomposition' with ``most uneconomical decomposition'.

    In practice, a 5-dimensional tas consists of a graded set (C_i)_i together with operations n-source, n-target: C_i → C_n, n-composition: C_q x_n C_p → C_{p+q+n-1}, and identity C_i → C_{i+1}, such that source, target, vertical composition (i.e., where one of p, q is n+1, so this includes whiskering) and identity behave as in an ω-category, and such that horizontal composition behaves as follows:    for c' and c n-composable, with source (c)=a and target (c')=a' say, the faces of c' comp_n c are given as a certain composites in C (a, a'). For example, for p=q=3 and n=0 the diagram is as on page 13 of [tpgc] (but with different labeling), and involves other horizontal composites, and their inverses.    functoriality: for example,     --  /  \ — .—-.   .  \  / —   --   gives rise to d comp_0 (c' comp_1 c) = (d comp_0 c') whiskerandcomp_1 (d comp_0 c). This becomes very complicated in higher dimensions (I gave a 5-dimensional example on a slide), involving more horizontal composites and their inverses, and involving lower-dimensional axioms, to make both sides close up. Sometimes it only involves lower-dimensional axioms, in which case it holds trivially.    associativity: for example,     —   —   — .     .     .     .   —   —   —   gives rise to the familiar Yang-Baxter diagram.    interchange: does not follow automatically, and needs to be included.    also need functorio-associativity, arising from         --  — /  \ — .   .—-.   .  ,  — \  / —       --   cf. the diagram on page 46 of [tpgc], and functorio-functoriality.

    Problem 1: how to determine where horizontal composites occur in the faces of a composite and in the axioms, and which direction they have.
    Problem 2: how to prove that all axioms close up.
    Problem 3: how to recognize which axioms follow from lower-dimensional ones.
    Non-problem 4: composition is a functor C(a,a') ``tensor' C(a',a') → C(a,a'), but this tensor product (of (Gray-Cat_tensor)-categories) is not associative. So, one could say this is not A, i.e., Z, tensor product. Still, there should be a suitable, post-modern, way to enrich with respect to it resulting in 5-dimensional teisi.

    In this talk I describe the logic found in a tos.  This turns out to be a restricted first-order intuitionistic predicate calculus: all the first-order operations an be constructed in a (mostly) standard topos-theoretic way, except for universal quantification.

    I describe an alternative, but well-known, construction of universal quantification and characterise the class of morphisms for which it applies in a tos: this characterisation is based on a simple notion of objects with a finite number of subobjects.

    This characterisation turns out to nicely show that in application to information systems modelling, a tos provides a logic effectively equivalent to the full first-order calculus.

  abstract: |-
    I discussed briefly the well-known construction of the free completion P(C) of a category C under a class P of colimits (meaning, of course, a class of weights). If C is small, this is formed as the closure of C in [C^op,Set] under P-colimits.

    I then looked at interated cocompletions Q(P(C)), where P and Q are different classes, and saw that this is still a full subcategory of [C^op,Set] provided that P-limits commute with Q-colimits. If Q is taken to be the class of all colimits commuting with P-limits, then for some but not all choices of P, it is the case that Q(P(C)) is all of [C^op,Set]. This condition on P holds if and only if for every P-continuous functor f:A→Set, the left Kan extension Lan_Y(f):[A^op,Set]→Set is also P-continuous.

    Next I looked at some particular classes P. If P is any of the following classes:    finite limits    k-small limits    finite products    connected limits    terminal object    finite connected limits    then the condition of the previous paragraph holds, but if P is the class of pullbacks, it does not.

    The class of colimits (meaning of course the class of weights) commuting with pullbacks is the same as the class of colimits commuting with finite connected limits. They can be formed as the iterated cocompletion Q(P(C)) where P is the class of filtered colimits and Q is the class of coproducts; or alternatively they can be formed as the itereated cocompletion P(R(C)) where P is again the class of filtered colimits, but R is the class of finite coproducts. As a corollary of the equivalence of Q(P(C)) and P(R(C)), we deduce that Fam(K) is finitely accessible if K is so. More generally, Fam(K) is k-accessible if K is k-accessible; this strengthens a result of Makkai and Paré which proves that Fam(K) is accessible if K is so.

  abstract: |-
    If T is a 2-monad on a 2-category K, then the existence of limits in the 2-category T-Alg of strict T-algebras, pseudo T-morphisms, and T-transformations is well-understood. The forgetful 2-functor from T-Alg to K creates flexible limits; these are a large and useful class, containing comma objects, inserters, equifiers, products, cotensor products, and inverters; they do not, on the other hand, contain equalizers or pullbacks. They are formed as the closure of the class of pseudolimits and idempotent-splittings.

    In this talk I look at the existence of limits in the 2-category T-Alg_l of strict T-algebras, lax T-morphisms, and T-transformations. I show that, although the forgetful 2-functor U_l:T-Alg_l→K does not create lax limits, it does create oplax limits and idempotent-splittings, and therefore admits products, cotensor products, and certain inserters, equifiers, and comma objects.

    At the end of the talk I speculated on the possibility that the notion of (horizontal) double limit due to Grandis and Pare could be useful in describing the limits which exist in T-Alg_l. There is a double category associated in a natural way to T-Alg_l, and this double category turns out to admit all horizontal double limits provided that K admits all limits.

  abstract: While working on her Honours Essay, Amy Young noticed that our paper  A. Joyal, R. Street and D. Verity, Traced monoidal categories, Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society   119 (3) (1996) 425-446; MR96m:18014  did not include a proof that the twist on the tortile monoidal category Int(V),  constructed from a traced monoidal category  V,  was natural.  The equality between string diagrams expressing this naturality is not so obvious so I explained the algebraic proof. Amy's Essay includes a nicely drawn geometric proof.

  speaker: Vaughan Pratt
  date: 1998-07-29T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Sydney
  abstract: |-
    A Chu space (A,r,X) over an alphabet K consists of a carrier A consisting of points a,a',..., a "cocarrier" X consisting of dual points or states x,x',..., and an "interaction matrix" r:AxX→K.  Morphisms are defined by analogy with continuous functions between topological spaces, with X as the set of open sets and r(a,x) as the "degree of membership" of point a in "open set" x; equivalently they may be understood as abstract adjunctions, the "right adjoint" to f:A→B being the map g:Y→X sending open sets of B to open sets of A.  As such Chu spaces amount to generalized topological spaces, with no closure conditions on the open sets and any (fixed) number of degrees of membership.  For ordinary Chu spaces, A, X, and K are sets and r is a function, while the V-enriched generalization takes these from any symmetric monoidal closed V. The category of V-enriched spaces with alphabet (dualizing object) k, introduced by Barr and his student Chu, is denoted Chu(V,k).

    We show that ordinary Chu spaces have a universal character indicated by several concrete full embeddings.  The category of n-ary relational structures and their homomorphisms so embeds in Chu(Set,2^n).  Any small category C embeds fully in Chu(Set,|C|) (K = the set of arrows of C). And any small concrete category embeds fully and concretely in Chu(Set,K) where K is the set of all elements of C, i.e. the disjoint union of the underlying sets of the objects of C.

  abstract: |-
    These talks were based on the paper A coherent approach to pseudomonads.

    Abstract:  The formal theory of monads can be developed in any 2-category, but when it comes to pseudomonads, one is forced to move from 2-categories to Gray-categories (semistrict 3-categories). The first steps in developing a formal theory of pseudomonads have been taken by Fransisco Marmolejo (see his papers Doctrines whose structure forms a fully faithful adjoint string and Distributive laws for pseudomonads, both published in and available from Theory and Applications of Categories), and we continue that program.

    We exhibit a Gray-category Psm such that a Gray-functor from Psm to a Gray-category A is precisely a pseudomonad in A; this may be viewed as a complete coherence result for pseudomonads. We then describe the pseudoalgebras for a pseudomonad, the morphisms of pseudoalgebras, and so on, in terms of a weighted limit in the sense of Gray-enriched category theory.

    We also exhibit a Gray-category Psadj such that a Gray-functor from Psadj to A is precisely a pseudoadjunction in A, show that every pseudoadjunction induces a pseudomonad, and that every pseudomonad is induced by a pseudoadjunction, provided that A admits the limits mentioned in the previous paragraph.

    Finally we define a Gray-category Psm(A) of pseudomonads in A, show that it contains A as a full reflective subcategory, which is coreflective if and only if A admits these same limits.

  speaker: Paddy McCrudden

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Tannaka duality is concerned with the reconstruction of a coalgebra from its category of of finite dimensional representations equipped with the forgetful functor into the category of vector spaces. In this seminar I provide sufficient conditions on a braided monoidal category V such that this theorem remains true when we replace the category of vector spaces in Tannaka duality with V.  I then construct a broad class of braided monoidal categories that satisfy these conditions.   In a little more detail, define a Maschkean category to be a cocomplete braided monoidal abelian category such that monics split.  Let V  be a Maschkean category and C a coalgebra in V.  I prove that C can be reconstrcuted from the functor Comod_f(C) → C.  This result is not new, and may in fact be deduced from [par96]. The problem, however is to construct a class of Maschkean categories. I prove that if V is a Maschkean categories, and H is a cobraided hopf algebra with an integral in V, then comod(H) is again Maschkean.    The proof of this result may be found in my thesis (forthcoming) which will be available on my webpage.

  title: Iterated localization for operads and the n-categorical tensor product problem
  speaker: Michael Batanin
  date: 1998-11-25T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Let E be an analytic functor on the category of (n+1)-globular sets Gl_{n+1}. That is we have a cartesian natural transformation from E to the free (n+1)-category functor D. In particular this means that

    E(X) → D(X)              |         |              |         |              V         V             E(1) → D(1)= Tr_{n+1}

    is a pullback. An (n+1)-operad is just a monoid in the monoidal (with respect to composition) category of analytic functors.

    Definition. E is normalized if (E(1))_0 = 1.

    This means that application of E to a globular set X does not change the objects of E. Let denote the monoidal category of normalized analytic functors by An^{norm}_{n+1}.

    I now can introduce the notion of analytic functor of k-variables. This will be a functor
                 E_k:Gl_n x ... x Gl_n → Gl_n   together with a cartesian natural transformation
                 E_k → D x ... x D.

    Now consider the following category Seq(An_n). The objects are sequences  {E_k, k>=0}, where E_k is an analytic functor of k-variables (for k=0 it is just an object of Gl_n). The morphisms are cartesian natural transformations.

    This category has a monoidal structure
    (E\otimes F)_m = \coprod_{k,j_1+...+j_k=m} E_k(F_{j_1},...,F_{j_k}).
    This is an honest tensor product because analytic functors are additive on each variables (this is different from usual definition of analytic functors on Set).

    Theorem. There is a strong monoidal equivalence of categories         An^{norm}_{n+1} ~ Seq(An_n}.

    To explain this theorem consider the following construction. Every n+1-globular set is just a graph in the category of n-globular set. Now let X_1,..., X_k be n-globular sets. One can consider the following graph G = G(X_1,...,X_k) of n-globular sets. Its set of objects is {0,...,n}. The only nontrivial globular sets of morphisms are G{j-1,j}= X_j. For j=0 we take G to have just 1 object 0 and empty set of morphisms.

    Let E be an n+1 normalized analytic functor. Then for n-globular sets X_1,...,X_k put
                    E_k(X_1,...,X_k) = E(G(X_1,...,X_k))(0,k)   The normalization condition is used here because E(G(X_1,...,X_k)) has {0,...,k} as the set of objects.

    This generates a sequence of analytic functors. There is also an inverse functor and both these functors preserve tensor product.

    Now we can give more general definition. Let C be a category and {E_k} be a sequence of functors
                   E_k:C x ... x C → C   We call this sequence an operad on C (what is not very good name, I will be happy if somebody could suggest something else) if there are given a multiplication
                 E_k(E_j_1,...,E_j_k) → E_{j_1 + ... + j_k}   and unit
                 Id → E_1

    satisfying usual associativity and unitary conditions. (This is a strange mixture of operadic and monadic structure, a sort of "categorification" of operads).

    Examples are monoid in Seq(An) and also any tensor product on C (put E_k(X_1,...,X_k)=X_1\otimes...\otimes X_k) and multiplication being asociativity isomorphism).

    One can define "categories enriched over C with an operad" in the same way as one define categories enriched over monoidal categories. I denote this category as Cat(C,E).

    Now for E\in An^{norm}_{n+1} we can define a corresponding sequence of analitic functors {E_k}. We also can normalize E_1. It means that I consider a suboperad of E_1 which consists of such operation e which have source and target in (E_1)_0 equal to 1 (which is a unit of a monoid (E_1)_0). Let this normalized operad be denoted by E^(norm).

    Now for every k we have an action    E_k(E^norm,...,E^norm)→ E_k(E_1,...,E_1) → E_k

    This allows us to construct the following operad \bar{E} on the category of E^norm-algebras . \bar{E} is a coeqalizer in Alg-E^norm of the pair

      E_k(E^norm(X_1),...,E^norm(X_k))===>  E_k(X_1,...,X_k),

    where the second morphism is induced by the structure E^norm-algebras morphisms.

    Theorem: The category of E-algebras Alg-E is equivalent to               Cat(Alg-E^norm,\bar{E}).

    This shows that the theory of weak n-categories can be constructed in the usual iterated manner  using this slightly more general notion of enrichment. How is this connected to the tensor product problem?

    Let us call an operad E totally normalized if E_{Z^k U_r}=1 for all k and r. This guarantees that we can avoid the normalization in our localization process. In addition, \bar{E_1} is isomorphic to identity and E_0=1. The algebras of such an operad have strict units for all possible compositions in algebras.

    Let us call a tensor product an (n+1)-operad E such that        \bar{\mu}:\bar{E_k}(\bar{E_j_1},...,\bar{E_j_k} →   → \bar{E_{j_1+...+j_k}}   are isomorphisms. The morphisms of tensor products are the operadic morphisms.

    So we have a subcategory Tens of Oper. My hypothesis is that the inclusion has a left adjoint. The only think that we need to show for this is that Tensor products are closed with respect to pullbacks. It would be sufficient for this to prove that the operation \bar{-} preserves some special pullbacks (it defenetely does not preserve all pullbacks). If it is true we can prove the following:  Let Tot(Tens) be subcategory of Oper such that for every E from Tot(Tens) any of its iterated localizations (...((E_1)_1)_1...)_1 is a tensor product. Then the inclusion functor has a left adjoint L_{tot}

    If we have this result then the problem of defining higher analogous of Gray-tensor product may be solved in a few steps.  Consider a universal contractible totally normalized operad K (this may be constructed by the same process as I described in my paper). Then we have an operad L_{tot}(K) and this is a tensor product. Moreover, I think this operad is contractible and this is exactly what we need.

    This talk was based on the paper of the same name, written with Max Kelly.

    Abstract:  There is a 2-category J-colim of small categories equipped with a choice of colimit for each diagram whose domain J lies in a given small class J of small categories, functors strictly preserving such colimits, and natural transformations. The evident forgetful 2-functor from J-colim to the 2-category Cat of small categories is known to be monadic. We extend this result by considering not just conical colimits, but general weighted colimits; not just ordinary categories but enriched ones; and not just small classes of colimits but large ones; in this last case we are forced to move from the 2-category V-Cat of small V-categories to V-categories living within some larger universe. In each case, the functors preserving the colimits in the usual ``up-to-isomorphism' sense are recovered as the pseudomorphisms between algebras for the 2-monad in question.

  abstract: |-
    Mathematics really never proves anything real, it just pulls together some theory, facts and reasoning within an agreed on frame of reasoning - ergo a body of knowledge.  The better the theory the more comprehensive the body of knowledge and perhaps the closer the theory is capable of describing and predicting "reality".  Thus understood reality is defined by our ability to construct it.

    CT provides us with a number of constructs that prove useful for describing conceptual structures in the problem (requirements) domain during the analysis phase of developing an information system.

    The purpose of the talk is to illustrate these constructs with some examples, to request a little patience if I miss some important subtleties, and ask some questions.  The early illustrations will be skipped over quickly.

    The constructs are:     Categories themselves (arrows, objects, composition and identity) and specification using sketches.    Commuting Diagrams (Consistent Dependency) which appear absolutely fundamental to information system structure     Products     Limits including the pullback in particular always seem to mean something useful     A 1-Cat to 2-Cat refinement which enables dynamics to be specified - see also work by Katis, Walters and others.  This also reveals that consistent dependency requires consistent role and vice versa, where role is defined by a permitted pattern of actions.    Specifying constraints with some additional structure.     Fibration, really opfibrations (equivalently indexed categories) as a means of abstracting clusters of object types

  abstract: 'The standard Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics is reinterpreted via the topos of sheaves on the state space of the system. The logic is intuitionistic and the associated real numbers, the sheaf of Dedekind reals,contains quantum numbers that are labelled by the self-adjoint operators of the standard formalism. These numbers are taken as the values of physical quantities associated with  the quantum system. A number of interesting consequences follow:   Quantum particles have trajectories.   If the dynamics, expressed in these numbers,is taken to be given by Newton''s equations of motion then Heisenberg''s operator equations of motion arise as local approximations.   The von Neumann- Luders projection postulate for measurement, also known as collapse or reduction of the wave packet, is an approximation to the description of the passage of a particle through a slit.

    This talk was based on the paper of the same name written with Enrico Vitale.

    Abstract:  We consider various (free) completion processes: the exact completion and the regular completion of a category with weak finite limits, the pre-regular completion of a category with finite products and weak finite limits, the exact completion of a regular category, the regular reflection of a pre-regular category, and the filtered-colimit completion of a small category. In each case we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the completion to be extensive; or, in the case of the pre-regular completion, for the completion to satisfy a weakened notion of extensivity which we call pre-extensivity.

    This is joint work with Domenico Gallo.

    We present a theorem that states that is possible to select (the maximum) in a vector of numbers withouth comparing its elements, i.e. it is possible to select by using only algebraic operations (addition, multiplication). The theorem lends itself to be implemented as a (possibly parallel) procedure that selects in constant time. Because of some bottlenecks, a circuit-like abstract implementation is provided using the bicategory of Spans of Reflexive Graphs recently studied by Katis et al. The hardaware implementation can constitute the core of many selection alghoritms: for instance we suggest also how to order a vector using the selection procedure.

  speaker: Steve Lack
  date: 1999-09-01T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Sydney
  abstract: |-
    This talk was based on Deligne's paper Action du groupe des tresses sur une catégorie, Invent. Math. 128:159-175, 1997.

    For any monoid M one can consider pseudoactions of the monoid on a category; these satisfy the usual axioms to be an action only up to coherent isomorphism. If the monoid M is not given explicitly but only by some presentation, one would like to be able to define actions in terms of the presentation. In general it is not known how to do this, but if all relations have the form g.h=k then one can define a ``pseudoaction of the presentation', and the category of all such will be equivalent to the category of pseudoactions of the monoid if the presentation satisfies a contractibility condition.

    A presentation of this kind is given for the monoid of positive braids on n strings; more generally such a presentation is given for the monoid of generalized positive braids corresponding to any finite Coxeter group.

    These talks were an exposé of some definitions and results in V.G. Turaev, Quantum Invariants of Knots and 3-Manifolds, de Gruyter, 1994 (MR 95k:57014) on tortile tensor categories, modular categories and their connection to low-dimensional topology.

    For V a strict tortile tensor category, an isotopy invariant F on V-colored ribbon graphs with values in V is given. V-colored ribbon graphs are a generalization of framed tangles, whose components are equipped with objects and morphisms of V.

    A (quasi-)modular category is an additive strict tortile tensor category equipped with a finite family of simple objects (quasi-)dominating the category and respecting some axioms.

    Considering F on such a modular category W allows its extension to a topological invariant tau of closed connected oriented 3-manifolds with embedded W-colored ribbon graphs.

    For A a ribbon Hopf algebra, the category of A-modules of finite rank quasi-dominated by a finite family of simple A-modules and respecting the axioms is a quasi-modular category.

    A non-trivial geometrical example of a quasi-modular category is the refined skein category.

  title: Non-permutative operads in a presheaf topos
  speaker: Mark Weber
  date: 1999-09-22T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    The higher operads of Michael Batanin can be thought of as a type of universal algebra where the arities are planar trees instead of natural numbers. The goal of these talks was to make this description precise, by giving a general definition of universal algebra and non-permutative operad for a presheaf topos, and indicating how in the case of globular sets, Batanin's operads are special types of non-permutative operads in this sense.

    Fix a small category C.

    Definition:  An arity for the presheaf topos [C^op, Set] is a monoidally dense fully faithful functor I : A → [C^op, Set] where A is small.

    That is, the essential image of the functor Lan_I : [A, [C^op, Set]] → End[C^op, Set] contains the identity and is closed under composition. This functor induces a "substitution" monoidal structure on its domain in such a way that it becomes strong monoidal (wrt composition in the codomain). One obtains endofunctors arising from collections and monads arising from non-permutative operads by considering the connected limit preserving endofunctors in the image of Lan_I.

    The classical example is where C =1, A = Set_f and I is the inclusion. The Batanin example will be C = G and A = tr = full subcategory of Glob consisting of those globular sets of the form T* for some tree T (see Batanin: "Monoidal Globular Categories as a Natural Environment for the Theory of Weak n-Categories" for the notation).

    In order to see Batanin's collections as collections in the above sense, we obtain a general characterisation of the connected limit preserving functors in the image of Lan_I, where I is as above except that it needn't be monoidally dense.

    Preliminary to the next definition, consider the functor [C/-, K] : C^op → Cat where K is an arbitrary category. For example, putying C = G one obtains cospan(K) in the sense of Batanin (ie the globular category of higher cospans, and if K has finite colimits then cospan(K) is actually a monoidal globular category).

    Definition:  The category C-Fam(A) has as objects, arrows f : L → [C/-, A] in [C^op, Cat], where L is discrete (ie in [C^op, Set]). An arrow (L,f) → (L', f ') consists of an arrow g : L → L'  and a 2-cell  g' : f 'g ==> f  in [C^op, Cat].

    Example:  1-Fam(Set_f) = Fam(Set_f) in the usual sense.

    Let A contain all its retracts (ie a retract of something in A is isomorphic to something in A). Then one obtains:

    Theorem: There is an equivalence of categories between C-Fam(A) and the full subcategory of End[C^op, Set] consisting of the (endofunctors arising from) collections.

    The case C = 1 of this theorem is contained in Carboni & Johnstone: "Connected Limits, Familial Representability and Artin-Glueing".

    As a corollary, a globular collection amounts to a globular functor L → cospan(tr) where L is a globular set. One can now recognise Batanin collections as such globular functors whose image consists of cospans that are canonical in a certain sense.

    All braided monoidal categories I'll consider in this talk are R-linear, where R is a fixed commutative ring. If C is such a braided monoidal category, we can take its completion C^ with respect to the ideal of morphisms generated by c - c^{-1}, where c is the braiding in C and c^{-1} is its inverse. I'll show that such a completion    provides the right categorical setting for the theory of Vassiliev invariants of links,    is the right one for an action of Drinfeld's Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller group (whose definition I'll recall) on braided monoidal categories to exist.    As a consequence of (1) and (2), we can construct an action of the absolute Galois group of the rationals on the Vassiliev invariants of framed links and tangles.

  abstract: |-
    In the beginning of the 1990's, Dehornoy, investigating selfdistributive systems, constructed a linear ordering on Artin's braid groups. Selfdistributive systems are sets equipped with a binary law satisfying the identity x(yz) = (xy)(xz). Such systems came up in the study of a large cardinal axiom in set theory. In this talk (which is an Eglish version of the talk I gave on 20 November 1999 at a Bourbaki Seminar in Paris) I present Dehornoy's work and its unexpected link with set theory. I also survey a recent geometric construction of Dehornoy's ordering by Fenn, Greene, Rolfsen, Rourke and Wiest.

  abstract: We begin by reviewing my talk The formal theory of monads revisited of 23 June 1999. For any bicategory  K , we define a bicategory  Mnde(K)  with the same objects and morphisms as the bicategory  Mnd(K)  of my paper The formal theory of monads, but with more 2-cells.  This turns out to make no difference to the formal theory of the construction of algebras as treated in my old paper.  The point of this talk is to explain a more general concept of distributive law arising by looking at monads in  Mnde(K).  We give an example from the cohomology of groups to show that these extended distributive laws are genuinely more general.

  speaker: Ross Street

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: A higher-dimensional version of the formal theory of monads could proceed in several directions.  In particular, monads in a bicategory could generalize to substitudes in tricategories. Substitudes are multicategories with several objects.  This talk defines multicategories in an arbitrary monoidal bicategory and describes their coherence.  With local coproducts in the monoidal bicategory, we go on to show that even these multicategories (as in the case considered by Burroni/Hermida/Leinster) are monads in a suitably constructed bicategory.  Recently Michael Batanin has been interested in the microcosmic phenomenon of operads within Cat-operads.  We discuss the relationship between operads in Cat-operads and multicategories in monoidal bicategories.

  abstract: Lawvere introduced the notion Cauchy completion for enrichments over V where V is a moinoidal closed category. He showed how this completion process captures the common notion of metric space completion. I want to present the following results. Quasi uniform spaces may be represented as enrichments over monoidal categories. Moreover (quasi-)uniformly continuous may be also represented by enriched functors. The quasi-uniform space completion is also a Cauchy-completion. To obtain these results I needed to introduce ``super'' monoidal functors. A 2-category with objects enrichments over diffrent bases needed be defined. In this general context, the Cauchy-completion still corresponds to a reflection.

    It is well-known that the character table does not provide a characterization of compact groups.  On the other hand, Tannaka duality shows that a compact group is characterized by its symmetric monoidal category of representations along with the forgetful functor.

    In this seminar we use a variant of promonoidal categories adapted to free coproduct completions to characterize cosemisimple quantum groups, among which lie compact groups. The data characterizing these algebras is simple combinatorial data: a set along with certain families of complex matrices satisfying various axioms. Such an object we tentatively call a contragroup.

    In the sequel to this seminar we will provide an explicit calculation of the dual contragroup of the group algebra of the group of symmetries of the triangle.

  location: Sydney
  abstract: |-
    Let C be a category with pullbacks and let E be a pullback-stable class of morphisms of C which is closed under composition with the isomorphisms. E defines a pseudofunctor from Cop to Cat, also denoted by E, which sends an object C to E/C, the full subcategory of the slice category C/C consisting of arrows in E with codomain C. We may then consider the category of E-descent morphisms in C as defined in G. Janelidze and W. Tholen, Facets of Descent I, Applied Categorical Structures 2, 1994:1-37.

    Suppose J is a Grothendieck topology on C which is generated by the subcanonical pretopology J' for which a family (Ci→D) is in J' if and only if: the coproduct C of the Ci exists, it is universal and disjoint, and the induced morphism C→D is both a universal regular epimorphism and an E-descent morphism.

    Using the Yoneda embedding Y:Cop→Sh(C,J) we prove several results related to E-effective descent morphisms, Galois objects, and torsors in C. As an application, we get the following two theorems.

    (For a commutative group G in C we denote by Gal(G,C) the abelian group of (isomorphism classes of) Galois G-objects.)

    Theorem 1 Let C be a category with pullbacks and let J be the Grothendieck topology on C as above. If G is a commutative group in E (i.e. the unique morphism from G to the terminal object lies in E) then every Galois homC(-,G)-object (= homC(-,G)-torsor) in Sh(C,J) is representable by a Galois G-object. (This means that if A is a homC(-,G)-torsor in Sh(C,J), then there exists a Galois G-object a in C such that A is isomorphic to homC(-,a).

    Theorem 2(a) Let B be a Grothendieck topos, and let R be a commutative ring in B. Denote by C the opposite of the category of commutative R-algebras, and let E be the class of all morphisms in C. If G is a cocommutative finite Hopf R-algebra with antipode, then there is an isomorphism between Gal(G,C) and Ext1Ab(Sh(C,J))(hom(-,Gx),hom(-,R[Z]) where J is the Grothendieck topology on C which is generated by finite families of pure morphisms, Gx is the R-dual of G, and R[Z] is the group ring.
    (b) Let X be a scheme, let C be the category of schemes over X, and let J be the Grothendieck topology on C which is generated by families of pure morphisms in C, in the sense of B. Mesablishvili, (Effective) descent morphisms in the category of schemes, in Abstracts of CT2000 (Como), 154-156. Deonte by E the class of quasi-compact pure morphisms. If G is a group in E which is locally a projective module over X, then Gal(G,C) is isomorphic to Ext1Ab(Sh(C,J))(hom(-,GK),hom(-,Gm) where GK is the Cartier dual of G, and Gm is the multiplication group scheme.

  location: Peace Park
  abstract: |-
    This is joint work with Brian Day and Paddy McCrudden.

    The definition and calculus of extraordinary natural transformations (in the sense of Eilenberg-Kelly) is extended to a context internal to any autonomous monoidal bicategory. The original calculus is recaptured from the geometry of the monoidal bicategory V-Mod whose objects are categories enriched in a cocomplete symmetric monoidal category V and whose morphisms are modules.  Since an exact pairing between an object and its dual is extraordinarily natural in the object, we are able to define dualization in any pseudomonoid in an autonomous monoidal bicategory directly generalizing the definition of an autonomous (= rigid) monoidal category.  The antipode of a quasi-Hopf algebra H in the sense of Drinfeld is another example obtained by changing the monoidal bicategory; then, the reason the category Comodf(H) of finite dimensional representations of H is autonomous is that the Comodf operation preserves dualization.

    If R is a commutative ring and C is a multiplicative set of elements of R, we all know how to form the quotient ring C-1R, and it is classical that there is a long exact sequence in algebraic K-theory. In surgery, it turns out to be important to study the the analogue where the ring R is not commutative.

    This talk described joint work with Max Kelly.

    I proved that V is a symmetric monoidal closed category which is locally k-presentable (in the sense of Gabriel-Ulmer), for some regular cardinal k, then the category V-Cat of (small) V-categories is also locally k-presentable.

    I also proved that if V is locally k-bounded as a closed category (in the sense of Max) then V-Cat is locally k-bounded; the definition of local boundedness is similar to that of local presentability, but rather than arbitrary k-filtered colimits uses only k-filtered unions of subobjects with respect to a given proper factorization system. Examples of symmetric monoidal closed categories which are locally bounded but not locally presentable include the various topological closed categories, such as the category of compactly-generated topological spaces.

    There is a preprint, which should be available soon ...

    I'll describe a cofibrantly-generated Quillen model structure on the category 2-Cat of 2-categories and 2-functors; the weak equivalences are the biequivalences, and 2-functors are (right) homotopic if and only if they are pseudonaturally equivalent. The model structure is proper, in the sense that weak equivalences are stable under pullback along fibrations and pushout along cofibrations. It is compatible with the monoidal structure given by the Gray tensor product, but not with the cartesian monoidal structure.

    Entity-Relationship-Attribute models use a graphical technique for displaying the objects of an information system and relationships among them. A suitable environment for specifying the objects and constraints of a system is the finite-limit, finite-sum sketches with a terminal node (we call them EA sketches). The category of models of an EA sketch in a lextensive category gives states of the system. It is an object of models of the sketch in a 2-category of lextensive categories. Moreover, modelling the same sketch in certain objects in other 2-categories defines both the query language for the system and the updates (the dynamics) for the system. This talk will consider modelling a sketch in an object of a 2-category, and describe the cases just noted.

Their proof essentially boils down to the correspondence between sections of f and relative divisors on X, but in order to make this run smoothly, they use the fact that the truncation up to degree 1 of Rf*Gm can be identified in a natural way with the ''Picard stack'' (symmetric group-like stack) on S of invertible sheaves on X.'

  title: Constructive Galois toposes
  speaker: Marta Bunge
  date: 2001-06-27T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    The notion of a Galois topos was origin ally considered implicitly by Grothendieck [AGV,AM] and explicitly by Moerdijk [M], as that of a pointed connected atomic Grothendieck topos E that is generated by its Galois objects (or normal atoms). A Grothendieck topos E is a Galois topos iff it is pointed connected locally connected and generated by its locally constant objects. Galois toposes are alternatively described as the classifying toposes BG for G a prodiscrete localic group (in Set).

    In joint work with Dubuc [CTGT] we ask what is the appropriate notion of a Galois topos in the unpointed case, where also the base category Set is replaced by an arbitrary base topos S.  We base our discussion on a  construction in [B] which associates, with any connected locally connected (possibly pointless) topos E, bounded over S, a prodiscrete localic groupoid G in S which plays the role of the fundamental group of E (i.e., which represents first-degree cohomology of E with coefficients in discrete groups in S). The classifying topos BE is a connected atomic topos denoted by Pi1cov(E), obtained as the limit of a filtered system of connected atomic toposes GU and connected locally connected transition maps, where the U run over a cofinal small system of coverings in E.

    By an S-Galois topos we mean (in [CTGT]) a connected atomic S-bounded topos E that is generated by its ``Galois families'. The S-Galois toposes are then shown to correspond precisely to the classifying toposes BG, for G a prodiscrete localic groupoid in S. Alternatively, S-Galois toposes are shown to correspond to those connected locally connected toposes bounded over S that are generated by their ``locally componentwise constant objects'.

    Recall that Barr and Diaconescu [BD] show that for each covering U in a connected locally connected topos E over S, an object X of E is U-split iff X is U-componentwise constant. Thus, in the case of a locally simply connected topos E over S, the associated topos GU is pointed. For U  connected, there is even a canonical point. However, for the general coverings U, a consistent choice of these points cannot (a priori) be made if the base topos S is arbitrary. Moreover, the connected coverings U in E do not form a cofinal system of coverings in E. Either one of these reasons explains why is it that the limit topos Pi1cov(E)= limUGU need not be pointed when the base topos S is arbitrary and so, that a (prodiscrete localic) groupoid is needed. However, as shown in [CTGT], if S is taken to be Set, then the resulting notion of Set-Galois topos agrees with the the original notion.  In particular, using non-constructive arguments, we show that Set-Galois toposes are always pointed, so that this assumption in [M] is superfluous.

    As shown in [BM] in the case where the base topos is Set, there is given a ``comparison map' Pi1cov(E)→ Pi1path(E) from the coverings to the paths fundamental group constructions associated with a connected locally connected topos E, where the ``paths fundamental group' of  E is that of [MW]. This is easily seen using that locally constant objects have the unique path-lifting property stated in terms of a pullback condition.  The existence of the comparison map in the case of an arbitrary base topos S can be shown as well, but it is  based on the observations that the locally componentwise constant coverings  (are complete spread objects in the sense of [BF] and) satisfy the (weaker) path-lifting property stated in terms of open surjections. In particular, if E is a Galois topos, then the notions of (i) a locally componentwise object, (ii) a complete spread object, and (iii) an object with an action by paths, are all equivalent for objects in E. A question that is still open concerns the equivalence of (just) the notions  (i) and (ii) (given above) under suitable conditions on the topos E (more general than the ``locally paths simply connected as in [BM], which identifies all three), in particular, the question of when is the full subcategory U(E) of complete spread objects in E (called ``unramified maps' in [FT]) is itself a topos bounded over S. As shown in [FT], U(E) is always, in some sense, a homotopy invariant of E. A sufficient condition for a complete spread object to be locally (componentwise) constant is a certain condition $\nabla$ given in [BF]. As stated in [BF], we ignore at this point if this condition is also necessary for the equivalence of U(E) with Pi1cov(E).

  title: A monadicity theorem for distribution algebras
  speaker: Marta Bunge
  date: 2001-07-04T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Sydney
  abstract: "If S is an elementary topos and W is its subobject classifier, then W(-):Sop→S is monadic by Pare's theorem (see also Mikkelsen [15]). Moreover, there exists an equivalence between Sop and the category of complete atomic Heyting algebras in S (over S, the latter equipped with the forgetful functor and its left adjoint - the free complete atomic Heyting algebra functor). \n\nIn [8] we prove a relative version of ParÃ©'s theorem motivated by an interesting interpretation of it in terms of distributions in the sense of Lawvere [13] and their algebraic duals. The relativization consists in replacing S by a topos E bounded over S, and by replaicing Sop by the category of S-valued distributions on E in the sense of Lawvere [13]. For E=S, with E bounded over S by the identity geometric morphism, the original theorem from [17] is recovered. \n\nThe basic set-up is that of a bounded geometric morphism e:E→S, whereby E is canonically regarded as an S-indexed category [18]. Further, it is an S-cocomplete S-indexed category, so that the notion of an S-cocontinuous functor m:S→S is meaningful. Such functors have been identified with S-valued distributions on the S-cocomplete category E. \n\nBy a distribution algebra in E (over S) [8] is meant an S-bicomplete S-atomic Heyting algebra H in E, notions which need to be defined. The terminology employed is suggested from teh contravariant equivalence which exists between (i) distribution algebras H in E over S and (ii) objects of the form m*(W) where m:E→S is an S-valued distribution on E, m* is its right adjoint, and W is the subobject classifier in S. \n\nThere is a \"double dualization monad\" on E whose category of algebras is equivalent to the opposite of the category of distribution algebras in E over S. Alternatively, the category DS(E) of distribution algebras in E relative to S is monadic over E by means of the forgetful functor U and its left adjoint F. \n\nHowever, we are seemingly forced to make a hypothesis on E as a topos over S for the monadicity to hold. We are able to prove that the (relative) monadicity theorem holds in two cases: (1) for any topos E which is an essential localization [14] of a presheaf topos, and (2) when the base topos S is Set. \n\nThe monadicity theorem for distribution algebras is in fact only dependent on the existence of a left adjoint F to the forgetful functor U from the category of distribution algebras in E to E, that is on the existence of free distribution algebras. This involves (among other things) the existence of S-cocompletions and needs further investigation. \n\nReferences   M. Barr and R. Paré, Molecular toposes, J. Pure Appl. Alg. 17(1980) 127-152.   J.

  title: Symmetric spectra
  speaker: Steve Lack

  abstract: |-
    The aim of this talk was to describe the paper M. Hovey, B. Shipley, & J. Smith, Symmetric spectra, J. Amer. Math. Soc. 13:149-208, 1999.

    I started by briefly reviewing spectra, as ``representing objects' for generalized cohomology theories. More precisely, spectra are the objects of the stable homotopy category, first defined by Boardman, which contains spaces as a full subcategory; generalized cohomology theories can then be described by passing from spaces into the stable homotopy category, and then homming into some spectrum.

    Then I described the Quillen model structure on the category of spectra defined in A.K. Bousfield and E.M. Friedlander, Homotopy theory of Gamma-spaces, spectra, and bisimplicial sets, in Geometric Applications of Homotopy Theory II, Lecture Notes in Mathematics 658, Springer. The resulting homotopy category is the stable homotopy category; this provides a simpler description than that of Boardman.

    The stable homotopy has all sorts of nice categorical structure (Margolis has conjectured that it can be characterized by five simple axioms), in particular it is symmetric monoidal. The symmetric monoidal structure, however, is not induced by a symmetric monoidal structure on spectra, which makes calculation rather difficult.

    The idea of Hovey, Shipley, and Smith is to replace the category of spectra by a different category - the category of symmetric spectra - which is symmetric monoidal, and which has a model structure for which the homotopy category is still the stable homotopy category, and moreover the symmetric monoidal structure on the stable homotopy category is induced by that on the category of symmetric spectra. The symmetric monoidal category of symmetric spectra is easily described; the model structure requires more work.

    A symmetric sequence is defined to be a sequence Xn of pointed simplicial sets, indexed by the natural numbers, with for each n an action of the symmetric group Sn on Xn. The category of symmetric sequences is symmetric monoidal closed: the tensor product is defined using convolution in the sense of B.J. Day, On closed categories of functors, in Lecture Notes in Mathematics 1970, Springer. The sequence (S0,S1,S2,...) has a natural structure of commutative monoid in the symmetric monoidal closed category of symmetric sequences, and a symmetric spectrum is a symmetric sequence equipped with an action of this commutative monoid. More concretely, this amounts to a symmetric sequence equipped with suitably equivariant maps S1xXn→Xn+1 for all n. The symmetric monoidal structure on the category of symmetric spectra is a formal consequence of the description of symmetric spectra in terms of actions of a commutative monoid.

    The weak equivalences for the relevant model strucure are called the stable equivalences. Although it is possible to define stable homotopy groups of symmetric spectra, they are not sufficient to determine the stable equivalences. Rather, the stable equivalences are the maps which are inverted by a certain class of cohomology theories.

  title: Aspects of the symmetric topos
  speaker: Marta Bunge

  location: Sydney
  abstract: |-
    This lecture will consist of a selected survey of the main (algebraic, geometric, and 2-categorical) aspects of teh symmetric monad and its generalization, the notion of an admissible KZ-doctrine [1,2,3,4,5] investigated so far.

    The symmetric topos M(E) was originally constructed (using forcing methods in topos theory) as the classifier of the Lawvere distributions on a topos E bounded over a base topos S [1]. An alternative construction was then given in [2] in an algebraic spirit and even having applications in algebra.

    In [3] it is shown that the equivalence (obtained therein by other means) between S-valued distributions on E and complete spreads over E with a locally connected domain, could alternatively be seen as an equivalence between the category of points of M(E) and the category of discrete fibrations [11] associated with the symmetric monad on E. This approach is particularly suited to an analogy with the original construction of the spread completion given by R.H.Fox [6].

    The algebras for the symmetric monad are identified [4] with the "linear objects" and this results in an interpretation of Waelbroeck's theorem in Functional Analysis [13] saying essentially that, for any topos E, the topos M(E) is the free "cocompletion" of E in the sense of admitting left Kan extensions along any essential geometric morphisms satisfying the BCC for comma objects.

    An abstract notion of an admissible KZ-doctrine M is introduced in [5] as a generalization of the symmetric monad by imposing a condition on bicomma objects on the usual KZ-doctrine [8]. In addition to the symmetric monad on TopS, there are other interesting applications, for instance in Theoretical Computer Science. In this general context, one can speak about M-fibrations and opfibrations, M-algebras, and of the M-comprehensive factorization, generalizing work of Street and Walters [12].

  title: Spreads and their completions
  speaker: Marta Bunge
  date: 2001-08-01T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Sydney
  abstract: |-
    The notion of a (complete) spread was introduced by R.H. Fox [6] in topology in order to give a common generalization of two different types of coverings with singularities (branched and folded). A different notion of a (proper) spread was given by E. Michael [10] in connection with topological cuts. In both cases, the basic ideas is that of a spread, meaning a continuous map p:Y→X, with Y locally connected, satisfying the property that the connected components (or more generally, the clopen subsets) of the p-1(U), for U the opens of X, form a base for the topology of Y.

    A topos-theoretic version of the notion of a spread was given by J. Funk and myself [3] as that of a geometric morphism p:F→E between toposes bounded over a base topos S, with F locally connected, for which there is a generating family a:f→p*(E) of F over E which is an S-definable morphism in the sense of Barr and ParÃ© [1]. Thus, we replace "complemented" by "definable", but over a Boolean topos, these two notions agree.

    The two types of completions (Fox [6] and Micheal [10]) have a topos-theoretic counterpart, which, unlike the notion of a spread, are far from obvious. We deal with the Fox-like completion in [3] and with the Michael-type completion in [5].

    An instance of complete spreads are the branched coverings, introduced in this context in [4] and (with minor variations) in [8]. On the other hand, the notion of folded cover has not been defined for toposes.

    Our original interest in complete spreads p:F→E (with a locally connected domain F over S) arose from the correspondence (proven in [3]) with the S-valued Lawvere distributions on E. One direction of the correspondence (the easy direction) had already been noticed by G. Bergman [2] in connection with cosheaves which, as we know, is a notion equivalent to that of distribution and well-known also in topology in connection with homology. In fact, it is clear from [6] that Fox was aware of the correspondence between complete spreads and cosheaves, but did not explicitate.

    In this lecture I intend to introduce the notion of a (Fox complete) spread in topology and then in topos theory. This requires a careful study of the classes of definable maps in a topos, as well as an incursion into the localic version of a notion of zero-dimensionality. The notion of "complemented element" can be said in many non-equivalent ways in the localic context (and they all seem to have originated in M. Jibladze, unpublished, but see [9]). The class of complete spreads has some properties (compositionality) but lacks others (unrestricted pullback stability). Its description is (still) too down to earth (meaning that we use sites) and we (Jonathon and I) would like to improve it. Thomas Streicher (private communication) has made some interesting observations of our notion of a spread.

    This lecture is based on work done in collaboration with Jonathon Funk [3]. The factorization theorems arising from our analysis in [3], as well as the case of the proper completion (which relates directly to distribution algebras in a fashion which we have not yet managed in the Fox-completion analogue), will prbably require a sequel to this lecture.

  title: Path-linearizable categories
  speaker: Marta Bunge

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    A category B is said to be path-linearizable [BN, BF] if it satisfies an ``interval glueing condition'. The latter (IG) is seen to be equivalent to the conjunction of two independent properties, namely (C) ``cancellation' and (FI) ``factorization lifting'.  Examples of path-linearizable categories are: any category free on a directed graph (in particular, the additive monoid N of natural numbers) and the additivive monoid R+ of non-negative real numbers.  It is proved in [BN] (see also [BF]) that over a path-linearizable category B, the category UFL/B of unique factorization lifting functors over B is a Grothendieck topos.

    The history of the above mentioned Bunge-Niefield theorem [BN] (Theorem 4.5) is a comedy of errors.  It had been claimed (with a sketchy proof) by F. Lamarche [Lam] that for any small category B, the category UFL/B of unique factorization lifting functors (or of discrete ConduchÃ© fibrations [C] but also [G]) is (always) a topos.  This claim remained undisputed (at best, ignored) for several years.  In a preliminary version to [BN], submitted to P. T. Johnstone (as editor) for the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra, Bunge and Niefield showed that the Lamarche claim was equivalent to the existence of a right adjoint to the canonical inclusion of UFL/B→Cat/B thus making UFL/B into a ``model-generated category' [N] and hence (in this case, also) a topos, which we then proceeded to ``prove'.  The statement, in this form, was shown by the said editor to be false, by exhibiting a counterexample (the independence square to the fact that UFL/B is in general a coreflective subcategory of Cat/B.  This led us to immediately locate the gap in our proof and to introduce accordingly the condition (IG) to repair it.  It also led the editor to publish his remarks in [J] even before our paper [BN] could appear in print.  An alternate proof, examining the role of each of the two conditions (C) and (FI) was then given in [BF], profitting this time partly from some useful remarks made in [J].

    In this talk I intend to add some new remarks to what is contained in [BN] and [BF], to wit:

    Establish the validity of an ``ambush/UFL' factorization in the context of path-linearizable categories, based on comprehension for a suitable fibration with $\Sigma$ and a terminal T,    Relate the path-linearizable categories to the MÃ¶bius categories of [CLL] and give a combinatorial characterization of UFL functors in terms of homomorphisms of incidence algebras, and    Discuss the notion of category of processes that arises from assuming the existence of a ``duration' (or length, or shape) functor on the control (or configuration) category, in connection with [Law],    Pose some questions regarding the 2-dimensional analogues of the UFL functors as defined in [S], and also regarding the version of the UFL functors for geometric morphisms introduced in [BN].

    Discussions with Ross Street and Bill Lawvere are gratefully acknowledged.

    Recently I have revisited my original approximation to a definition of "weak ω-category" (as a simplicial set with extra structure) trying to remember some of the things I have thought of since those days. The main thing I want to report is a method of constructing the thin elements from the mere simplicial set so that being a weak ω-category becomes a property of a simplicial set rather than involving extra structure. I have many conjectures.

  abstract: 'Background  A well-known method for    constructing a category which contains both the open and the closed    subspaces of a given space (or the open and the closed subtoposes of a given    topos) is to perform a collage or glueing along a fringe functor.The    resulting category inherits properties of those one starts with (e.g., a    topos, a presheaf topos [CJ]). Another method is to consider the    locally closed inclusions into a given space X. These agree with the    UFL inclusions and are precisely the exponentiable subspaces of X [N].    This method applies also to small categories and to toposes [BN].          Twisting and Glueing  In the context of an admissible    KZ-doctrine M on a 2-category K, we now assume that the canonical action    of the discrete opfibrations over an object E on the discrete fibrations    over E (to be described) admits a right adjoint d (thought of as    density or interior). Define a category Tw(A,B) of twisted morphisms of    bifibrations (for M) from A to B. Assume that K  has a terminal object T.    We now prove the following new result.       Theorem. There exists an    equivalence of categories between Tw(E) and the category obtained by    glueing along d.      Some applications of this theorem will be given. The concrete example    of the symmetric monad is dealt with in [BFu] by other methods not    available in the general context.            A comparison theorem of single universes for discrete    fibrations and discrete opfibrations in the usual sense.     In [BFi] we observed that for A any set and M(A) the free monoid on A,    letting P(A) consist of the poset of post-extensions in the path-category    M(A)#, there is a canonical inclusion of presheaves on the    latter into the category UFL/M(A), and that this inclusion admits a right    adjoint (unfolding). We now prove the following new result.      Theorem. Let B be a category which admits a    duration functor into a a commutative monoid T satisfying the    cancellation properties that appear in [Law] (and which together have    the consequence that every morphism in B is both an epi and a mono,    e.g., T is taken to be the additive monoid of natural numbers or    that of the non-negative reals). Then there is an inclusion of the    category Tw(P(B)) into the category UFL/P(B)  .     We remark that whereas the former is a topos (in fact a presheaf    topos) the latter need not even be a topos [J], except in the case where    B also satisfies the fill-in property [BN] [BFi]. The above result    extends to the case of an arbitrary (locally connected) topos E,    with the notion of a UFL geometric morphism introduced in [BN].      Open questions  These will be posed at the lecture.

  title: The fundamental group of a (universal) branched covering in topos theory
  speaker: Marta Bunge
  date: 2001-10-10T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Sydney
  abstract: 'Background  Branched coverings in topos theory [BN] [Fu] may be described (in several ways with varying degrees of abstraction) in terms of the more general notion of a complete spread [BF]. The goal of this talk is to establish a theorem relating the fundamental group of a (universal) branched covering of a topos with that of the (universal) covering of its unbranched part.    Motivation.  The main motivation comes from theorem of R.H. Fox [Fox] (Section 7) for locally finite complexes, where, however, the fundamental group of a branched covering is directly given in terms of paths rather than by exploiting the Galois theory that is inherent in the given (branched and unbranched) coverings. I set out to prove one key ingredient of this theorem in the general context of an admissible KZ-doctrine in the sense of [BF2], satisfying an additional axiom of "interior" (or "density").     Definitions.  Context: an admissible KZ-doctrine M satisfying an axiom of interior on a 2-category K.    (a) A "branched covering" over an admissible object E relative to a fully faithful (and final) discrete opfibration f: X → E is a discrete fibration h: D → E whose interior g = d(h): Y → E factors (necessarily uniquely) through f: X → E, by means of an "unbranched covering", meaning a 1-cell k:Y→X which is at the same time a discrete fibration and a discrete opfibration.    (b) A branched covering h: D →E relative to f:X→E is said to be a "universal branched covering" if its associated unbranched covering k:Y →X has the property that every endomorphism of k is an automorphism. Note: It follows that any endomorphism of h is an automorphism.    Theorem. Let M be an admissible KZ-doctrine in a 2-category K satisfying an axiom of interior. Let E be an admissible object of K and let h:D→E be a universal branched covering of E relative to a fully faithful discrete opfibration f: X→E. Let k:Y→X be the associated universal (unbranched) covering. Denote by Aut(h) and Aut(k) the corresponding (discrete) groups of automorphisms. Then there is given a canonical group isomorphism Aut(h)→> Aut(k).     Proof. The proof of this theorem involves, besides some properties of the admissible KZ-doctrine M with an axiom of interior, just the comprehensive factorization in K relative to M and the given definitions.     Examples.  The motivating example for the above definitions and theorem is that of the 2-category K of Grothendieck toposes with M the "symmetric KZ-doctrine", where the axiom of interior is satisfied on account of the existing notion of density of a distribution [BF}. In this context the notions and theorem stated above can be shown to have familiar interpretations. Other examples from [BF2] are in principle amenable to a similar analysis.     Acknowledgements.

My talk concentrated on our lemma on restriction of lax promonoidal structures along a V-functor.  A relevant easy example is the lax promonoidal structure on the cyclic groupoid (that is, the disjoint union of the cyclic groups). I noted that Lie algebra objects could be defined with mere cyclic symmetry.  I showed how the main example of "pseudotensor category" in [BDK] fitted into a general convolution construction giving an embedding of their category into a more conventional monoidal category.

    Joint with Alexei Davydov and Brian Day

    Write  V  for the category of complex vector spaces, write  S  for the symmetric groupoid (a skeleton of the category of finite sets and permutations), and write   C  for the cyclic groupoid (whose objects are natural numbers and arrows n → n  are elements of the cyclic group of order  n.  There is a faithful functor  J : C → S  which is the identity on objects.

    We use the term "substitude" for lax procomonoidal V-category.  It is possible to define Lie algebra objects in symmetric (or even cyclic) substitudes. Representable substitudes are oplax monoidal V-categories.

    Addition of natural numbers gives a monoidal structure on  S  which "restricts" (see my last talk) to a substitude structure on  C. Since  S  and  C  are self dual, we also can regard these structures on  Sop  and  Cop.

    The main result is that the convolution oplax monoidal structure on the category [C,V]  of linear representations of  C  is identical to the "restriction" of the convolution structure on the category  [S,V] of linear representations of S  (this is the category of "tensorial species" in Joyal's terminology of SLNM 1234) along the functor LanJ : [C,V] → [S,V].

    Consider the free Lie algebra functor  L : V → V;  it is a Lie algebra in [V,V]  for the pointwise tensor product.  "Taylor series" T : [S,V] → [V,V]  takes the convolution structure to pointwise tensor product.  Joyal (loc. cit.) shows that there is a Lie algebra lie  in  [S,V]  such that  T(lie) = L.

    A classical theorem of A.A. Klyachko ["Lie elements in a tensor algebra" Sibirsk. Mat. Z. 15 (1974) 1296-1304, 1430; MR# 51 8178] provides an object  l  of  [C,V]  taken to  lie  by  Lan_J.  Indeed, the linear representation  ln  of the cyclic group Cn is the one-dimensional vector space acted on by all the n-th roots of unity. See also H. Barcelo and S. Sundaram ["On some submodules of the action of the symmetric group on the free Lie algebra" J. Algebra 154 (1993) 12-26].

    Our main result, together with the fact that  LanJ  is faithful (since the inclusion  H → G  of any subgroup is a split monic at the H-module level), implies that we obtain a Lie algebra object structure on  l  in the oplax monoidal category  [C,V].  We have (LanJ)l = lie  as Lie algebras.

  title: Extensivity for 2-categories

  abstract: |-
    This talk was based on joint work with Marta Bunge, and now forms part of a paper entitled Van Kampen theorem for toposes. to appear in Advances in Mathematics. The talk builds on my talk of the previous week Extensivity for 2-categories.

    Brown and Janelidze (Van Kampen theorems for categories of covering morphisms in lextensive categories, J. Pure Appl. Alg. 119:255-263, 1997) proved an abstract van Kampen theorem in the context of an extensive category K equipped with a suitable class F of morphisms of K to be thought of as ``coverings'. In this talk I described a generalization of the theorem of Brown and Janelidze. The extensive category K was replaced by an extensive 2-category K, and the class F was replaced by a pseudofunctor A:Kop→CAT which preserves binary products. Our abstract van Kampen theorem then stated that A sends certain pullback diagrams in K to pullbacks in CAT; the hypotheses on the pullback diagrams were expressed in terms of descent theory.

    In our main example, K is the 2-category TopS of toposes bounded over a base topos S, and A is the pseudofunctor sending a topos E to its subcategory of locally constant objects.

    Some applications involving branched coverings and knot groups were given by Marta in the following talk, Locally path simply connected toposes and their fundamental groupoids.

  abstract: 'Outline  The lecture will consist of two parts, as    follows.      In the first part we begin by recalling the definitions and properties    of certain classes of geometric morphisms, such as connected locally    connected (c.l.c.) and surjective local homeomorphisms (s. l.h.). This is    followed by a review of the main result of [BM], which consists on    establishing the equivalence of a natural comparison map from the paths    to the coverings fundamental groups of an unpointed topos E bounded over    an elementary base topos S ([MW],[M],[B]).        The second part is joint work with Steve Lack [BL]. The general theme    of [BL] is to establish a Van Kampen theorem for toposes (bounded over a    base topos S) in terms of their fundamental groups (coverings and    paths) and to apply it to branched coverings and the fundamental group    of a knot, motivated by work of R.H.Fox [Fox]. In this lecture I complement    results presented by my co-author Steven Lack, in which, first, a    2-categorical version of a theorem of Brown and Janelidze [BJ] is    given, with an application to a van Kampen theorem for covering    projections of toposes, and second, on the result that the 2-category    Top_S of toposes bounded over S is lextensive as a 2-category.  .     In this lecture, after reviewing the notion of a locally paths    simply connected (l.p.s.c.) topos and recalling the results mentioned    above, I turn to a proof of the following results.      Theorem.(Van Kampen theorem for toposes) Let E, E_0, E_1    and E_2 be c.l.c. and l.p.s.c. toposes, with E_1 and E_2 subtoposes of E    having intersection E_0 in E. Assume that the induced geometric morphism    p: E_1 + E_2 → E is a surjective local homeomorphism.    Then, the induced square of (paths) fundamental group toposes (P_1(E_0),    P_1(E_1), P_1(E_2) and P_1(E)) is a pushout of toposes.       Corollary. In the context of the above theorem, assume    furthermore that the inclusions E_1 >→ E and E_2>→E    are local homeomorphism and that E_2 is paths simply connected. Then,    in the pushout of fundamental group toposes, the geometric morphism    P_1(E_1) → P_1(E) is connected locally connected, and the    composite P_1(E_0)→P_1(E_1)→P(E) factors though a point S→P(E)    via the structural map P_1(E_0)→S.       In order to derive an application of the above to the fundamental group    of a knot in this general context, we recall the following definition, given    in [BN] and [Fu] but both following [Fox]. The intuition is that E_1  >→E    is the inclusion of the open complement of a knot Z>→E in E, and that    E_2>→E is an inclusion into E of a paths simply connected subtopos    containing Z>→E, and that E_1 and E_2    together cover E.       Recall that by the fundamental group of the knot embedded in say R^3,    it is meant (see [R]) the fundamental group of its complement. In an    alternative treatment of (topological) knot invariants, Fox [Fox] suggested    using the category Br_Z(E) of branched coverings over E with the    knot Z as their branching set. In the context of toposes, this has a    precise meaning, as follows.       Definition Let E be a connected locally connected    topos. Let a given local homeomorphism inclusion E/Y >→E.    Denote by Br_Y(E) the full subcategory of Top_S/E determined by those    complete spreads over E with locally connected domain, assumed to be the    spread completions of a local homeomorphism E/X→E which factors    through the inclusion E/Y>→E by means of a covering projection    E/X→E/Y.       We now give a justification for using branched covers (instead of    paths) to calculate (via automorphisms) the fundamental group of a knot.      PropositionIn the context of the above definition, there    is a canonical equivalence of  Br_Y(E) with P_1(E/Y).      In topological applications, a base point p is chosen and assumed to    belong to E, E_1, E_2 and (therefore) E_0, but this point p is not to    lie on the knot (whose complement in E is E_1). When the    toposes are pointed, the fundamental groups of these pointed toposes are    (discrete localic) groups. In this setting, we can say something quite    specific.       Corollary With assumptions as in the Corollary of the    van Kampen theorem for toposes, and with the additional assumption    that the topos E_0 is pointed by means of a geometric morphism    p:S→E_0, let G(E,p), G(E_1, p) and G(E_0, p) denote the (discrete localic)    groups classified by the respective fundamental group toposes. Then,    the induced continuous group homomorphism h: G(E_1, p) → G(E, p) is    surjective, and its kernel is precisely the image N of the continuous    homomorphism k: G(E_0, p) → G(E_1, p). It follows that G(E, p) is    the quotient (discrete localic) group G(E_1, p)/N.

  abstract: |-
    The Dedekind-MacNeille completion of a poset is a complete (and cocomplete) lattice, generated and cogenerated by the original poset. The inclusion moreover preserves any meets and joins that the poset may have had already.

    In his 1966 book on completions (Springer LNM vol 24) Lambek asked for a categorical generalization of the Dedekind-MacNeille completion. In 1974, Isbell has demonstrated that no extension of the group Z_4, where all objects are both limits and colimts of the original group, can be complete.

    I describe a completion, based on the Chu construction, which satisfies a slightly weaker generation requirement, but still restricts to the Dedekind-MacNeille completion on posets.

    (Btw, I tend to call it the Dedekind-MacChu completion, which could be an informative title for the talk, but may also be considered too silly if there are lots of serious people in the siminar.)

    Higraphs, a kind of hierarchical graphs, are prominent structures in computing, underlying a number of sophisticated diagrammatic formalisms such as Statecharts and UML. Starting with a formalisation of higraphs as graphs in the category Poset, we explore the universal properties associated with a number of practically important operations on higraphs, such "zooming" and "completion". Further, the symmetric monoidal closed structure of the category H of higraphs will be exposed and related to the so-called "other" such structure on Cat. Brief excursion will be made on how the study of higraphs motivates the study of Graphs(C), the category of graphs in a locally ordered category C, and on how many higraph-specific results arise in this more general setting. Time permitting, general issues pertaining to a theory of diagrammatic notations in computing will be discussed.

    I would like to encourage questions and discussion during the talk rather than stick to a firm agenda.

  abstract: 'Multi-categories, introduced by Lambek in 1969, are known to admit a   very elegant global description, where monads are employed at two   levels: first the free monoid monad is used to suitably ``skew'''' the   bicategory of spans nad then monads in the resulting bicategory are   considered.  A very natural generalization of multi-categories was   introduced by Szabo in 1975 poly-categories, however by means of a   local definition.  We provide the missing global characterization,   thereby extending the notion of T-category for a cartesian   monad T to situatons where both sides of spans are to be   subjected to (possibly different) monads.'

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    The 2-monad (-)^2 on CAT has unit I described by identities, and multiplication C described by composition. For a category K, a functor F : K2 → K satisfying FI = 1 admits a unique, (normal) pseudo-algebra structure for (-)2 if and only if there is any natural isomorphism F(F2) → FC. When this is the case, the unique coherent natural isomorphism satisfies a simple equation. Moreover, the set of all natural transformations F(F2)→ FC forms a commutative monoid isomorphic to the centre of K.

    As Korostenski and Tholen showed, such `factorization algebras' are of interest as they correspond to factorization systems on K.

  title: Modules for substitudes
  speaker: Ross Street
  date: 2002-06-12T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    While James Dolan was visiting Macquarie he convinced me that (two-sided) modules for the terminal monoid in the monoidal category Set/N,  with substitution tensor product, are precisely monoidal functors from the opposite of the algebraic simplicial category (with ordinal sum) to Set  (with cartesian product).  Alexei Davydov rediscovered the result and asked me whether I had a conceptual reason for it.  This topic grew out of that question.

    The importance of considering such (two-sided) modules comes from Batanin's idea [appearing in "Monoidal globular categories as a natural environment for the theory of weak  n-categories", Advances in Math  136 (1998) 39-103]  that morphisms of weak ω-categories are definable using a deformation of the identity module of the higher operad  K  for weak ω-categories.

    Monoids in the substitution monoidal category  Set/N  are of course (not-necessarily-symmetric) operads.  [The terminal monoid is the operad for monoids.]  An operad is a substitude structure on the terminal category  1  (see Day-Street "Abstract substitution in enriched categories" available on my publication web site). Generalizing the fact that each operad gives rise to a strict monoidal category (the PROP without the second "P" for permutations), each substitude  B  gives rise to a strict monoidal category  B^*. There is also a standard convolution lax monoidal structure on the functor category  [A, Set]  for any substitude  A.  Recall from Day-Street "Lax monoids, pseudo-operads, and convolution, Contemporary Mathematics (to appear)" that substitudes are monads in an appropriate Kleisli bicategory, so the notion of "bimodule" between substitudes has a straightforward meaning.  I claim that such a module from the substitude  A  to the substitude  B  is a morphism (B*)op→[A,Set] of lax monoidal categories (where  (B*)op has the lax monoidal structure coming from the strict monoidal B*  while  [A,Set]  has the standard convolution structure. This generalizes Dolan's observation.  A conceptual reason for this generalization begins with the observation that B*  is obtained by the Kleisli construction for a certain monad on the free strict monoidal category on  B  in a suitable module bicategory of lax monoidal categories.

  abstract: |-
    The talk revisited the last few pages of my paper

    "Characterization of bicategories of stacks", Lecture Notes in Math. 962 (1982) 282-291

    dealing with stacks and torsors.  I will restrict myself here with describing the factorization system alluded to in the title of the talk.

    Let  E  be a category with some distinguished morphisms called "covers" satisfying a few simple axioms (like regular epimorphisms in a regular category).  Let  F  =  Hom (Eop , Cat)  be the 2-category of "categories varying over  E"  (that is, the objects are pseudofunctors from  Eop  to  Cat).

    A morphism  j : X → Y  in  F  is called ccff  (meaning "cover cartesian and fully faithful") when its components  j_U : XU → YU are all fully faithful and the squares expressing pseudonaturality, that involve a morphism of  E  which is a cover  V → U,  are pseudopullbacks.

    A morphism  s : A → B  in  F  is called lso  (meaning "locally surjective on objects") when, for all objects  b  of each  BU, there exists a cover  e : V → U  and  a  in  AV  such that  (s_V)a is isomorphic to  (Be)b.

    These two classes of morphism determine a factorization system on the bicategory  F.  Each morphism  f : A → X  in  F  factors pseudofunctorially as  A → Z → X  where  ZU  consists of those  x in  XU  that are "locally isomorphic to an object in the image of f_U ".

    In particular, for a category  A  in  E,  this factorization applied to the "yoneda embedding of  A" yields the stack  Tors(A)  of torsors over  A.

  title: Even more braidings
  speaker: Ross Street
  date: 2002-10-30T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Two questions came up at the Fields Institute conference towards the end of September 2002. They both led to more examples of braidings. In his lecture, Bill Lawvere suggested that, while Eilenberg-Kelly [LaJolla] had determined the scarcity of symmetries on graded modules over a commutative ring K, the situation for doubly graded modules would be richer.  In fact, there is a braiding for each choice of four invertible elements a, b, c, d  of  K;  it is induced by convolution from the braiding

    amnbmn'cm'ndm'n': (m,m') + (n,n') → (n,n') + (m,m')

    on the free monoidal ModK-category  K*(Z x Z) on the discrete monoidal (under addition)  Z x Z.  The braiding is a symmetry iff

    a2 = bd = d2 = 1.

    In particular, for doubly graded abelian groups (where a, b, c, d must be 1 or -1), there are 16 braidings, 8 of them symmetries.  Of course, not all of these are braided monoidally inequivalent.

    After my lecture at the Fields Institute, Peter Schauenburg asked whether my formal representation theory extended to an explanation of the double/centre construction. I still have no proper answer for this. However, the question led me to consider a generalization of the centre construction. I call it the "external centre of a pseudomonoid"; the pseudomonoid can live in any braided monoidal bicategory, while the construction yields an ordinary braided monoidal category.  When the braided monoidal category is the cartesian monoidal bicategory  Cat, so that a pseudomonoid is a monoidal category  V,  the construction yields the centre  Z(V)  of V  as per Joyal-Street [Tortile Yang-Baxter operators in tensor categories, JPAA 71 (1991) 43-51].

  abstract: |-
    A useful general concept of bialgebroid seems to be resolving itself in recent publications; we give a treatment in terms of modules and enriched categories. We define the term "quantum category".  The definition of antipode for a bialgebroid is less resolved in the literature.  Our suggestion is that the kind of dualization occurring in Barr's star-autonomous categories is more suitable than autonomy (= compactness = rigidity).  This leads to our definition of quantum groupoid intended as a "Hopf algebra with several objects".

  abstract: The requirement that the Pauli exclusion principle holds for SU(3) colour leads unavoidably to a symmetric (and more importantly) premonoidal structure. An outline of this conclusion will be presented including the consequence that quark state confinement is an unavoidable condition for consistency in QFT. This does not imply spatial confinement, only that an individual quark cannot be isolated. Also in this talk I hope to present all this in the context of a category with a braided premonoidal structure including appropriate coherence results.

  abstract: |-
    This talk is a follow-up of the talk of last week, which only introduced the basic motivation for studying a form of homotopy which "does not reverse time". In this presentation, I will construct a category of globular CW-complexes, (common work with Philippe Gaucher, IRMA Strasbourg) which are to be the counterparts of the usual CW-complexes, for directed topology. These will be quickly compared with (pre-)cubical sets and local po-spaces, which are other well-known models for directed topology. Then I will define directed homotopy equivalence and consider the localization of the category of globular CW-complexes with respect to this equivalence.

    Some examples will be given together with some relationships to ordinary homotopy types. I will end up by introducing a new construction of the directed homotopy category, due to Philippe Gaucher, based on a category of "flows", which forms a model category.

  abstract: In this last talk, I will come back to ground level, and try to "compute" some fundamental categories in some fairly simple cases, but still of some value on the computer-scientific side. The idea is that the fundamental category is "essentially finite" in some nice cases, and that we ought to be able to describe it by some kind of generators and relations. This reduction to finite information, when possible, is done through various categories of fractions constructions. This could also be seen as a first attempt to understand a bit better the T-homotopy in Flow (of P. Gaucher). This is work (joint with M. Raussen, L. Fajstrup and E. Haucourt) in progress, and is certainly not polished at all, all comments will be \ gratefully acknowledged.

  abstract: |-
    There is a construction which lies at the heart of descent theory. The combinatorial aspects of this paper concern the description of the construction in all dimensions. The description is achieved precisely for strict n-categories and outlined for weak n-categories. The categorical aspects concern the development of descent theory in low dimensions in order to provide a template for a theory in all dimensions.  The theory involves non-abelian cohomology, stacks, torsors, homotopy, and higher-dimensional categories.  Many of the ideas are scattered through the literature or are folklore; a few are new.

It may be that homological methods could help to settle these.

  abstract: |-
    Using the notion of generic morphism (for an endofunctor) from [1], I described a characterisation of the image of the left kan extension 2-functor

    Lan_{I} : [P, Cat] → [Cat, Cat]

    where P (is a skeletal version of) the category of finite sets and bijections, and I is the (2)-functor that regards each finite set as a discrete category.

    This characterisation is a "categorification" of Andre Joyal's characterisation of analytic endofunctors of Set (and the corresponding natural transformations) found in (the appendix of) [2].

    It is obtained by   viewing endo-2-functors of Cat (in the obvious way) as as endofunctors of the category OpLax[2,Cat] of functors 2 → Cat and op-lax natural transformations between them, where 2 is the ordinal {0,1}. By the way, the 2-cells in OpLax[2,Cat] aren't used in this work, so we regard it as a mere category.   viewing 2-natural transformations and modifications between endo-2-functors of Cat (both) as natural transformations between the corresponding endofunctors of OpLax[2,Cat].    then applying Joyal's approach to characterising analytic functors (and nats) as formalised in [1].

    AndrÃ© Joyal has pointed out to me that there is an error in my Quillen model structure for 2-categories. I fix the error. Along the way, I describe a Quillen model structure for the category Bicats of bicategories and strict homomorphisms of bicategories. I also show that the canonical adjunction between Bicats and 2-Cat is a Quillen equivalence between the model categories.

  abstract: Catn-groups are a type of higher dimensional categorical structure; they were introduced in 1982 as algebraic model of n-types. A connection between these structures and homological algebra was established at that time. Recent developments link Catn-groups with homotopical  algebra. After recalling this background, we will introduce a (co)homology theory of crossed modules with coefficients in a pi_1-module, and we will describe its main properties.

    Abstract:

    A PROP is a way of encoding structure borne by an object of a symmetric monoidal category. We describe a notion of distributive law for PROPs, based on Beck's distributive laws for monads. A distributive law between PROPs allows them to be composed, and an an algebra for the composite PROP consists of a single object with an algebra structure for each of the original PROPs, subject to compatibility conditions encoded by the distributive law. An example is the PROP for bialgebras, which is a composite of the PROP for coalgebras and that for algebras.

    This talk was based on joint work with Pawel Sobocinski, and now forms part of a preprint entitled Adhesive categories, available as RS-03-31 in the BRICS Report Series.

    I defined {\em van Kampen squares} to be pushouts along monomorphisms which are "well-behaved" in the sense that coproducts in extensive categories are well-behaved. I defined a category to be {\em adhesive} if it has all pullbacks, pushouts along monomorphisms, and the latter are van Kampen squares. Every topos E is adhesive, but so are its slices e/E. Every adhesive category with a strict initial object is adhesive. I developed a little of the theory of adhesive categories, and explained the connection between van Kampen squares and the van Kampen theorems of topology; this involves the categorical van Kampen theorem of Brown and Janelidze [Van Kampen theorems for categories of covering morphisms in lextensive categories, JPAA 119:255-263, 1997.]

  speaker: Steve Lack
  date: 2003-11-19T14:00:00.000Z

  abstract: |-
    This talk is based on joint work with Simona Paoli.

    For a complete and cocomplete symmetric monoidal closed category V, write Op(V) for the category of (symmetric) operads in V. There is a symmetric monoidal closed on the category Cat(V) of internal categories in V, with the closed structure defined in the usual way (with "internal functor categories"). Thus it makes sense to talk about operads in Cat(V). The main result of the talk is the equivalence of categories Cat(Op(V))=Op(Cat(V)).

    In the special case where V is abelian, there is an equivalence Cat(V)=V2 with the category of morphisms in V, and so Cat(Op(V))=Op(V2). In the further special case where V is the category of graded modules overy a commutative ring, the operads in Op(V2) were studied in a recent preprint of Baues, Minian, and Richter, and called secondary operads. We offer the characterization in terms of internal categories in Op(V) as a conceptually simpler point of view.

    The second result of the talk concerns the case of an operad T in V, seens as a discrete internal category cat(T) in Op(V); by the first result we may also regard cat(T) as an operad in Cat(V). We show that cat(T)-Alg=Cat(T-Alg), so that internal categories in the category T-Alg of T-algebras can be seen as algebras for the operad cat(T)-Alg.

    In the context of Baues, Minian, and Richter, there is an operad (0,T) in V2 whose algebras are defined to be crossed modules of T-algebras. This operad corresponds under the equivalence Op(Cat(V))=Op(V2) to cat(T). Thus our result provides further justification for this name by showing that crossed modules are equivalent to internal categories.

  date: 2003-11-26T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    This is a continuation of last's week talk on joint work with Simona Paoli. It deals with the case of finite limit structures other than internal categories.

    For locally finitely presentable K, there is a corresponding finite limit theory (the opposite of the full subcategory Kf of K consisting of the finitely presentable objects) and K is the category of models in Set of the theory. For an arbitrary category A with finite limits, write K(A) for the cateogry of models in A of the theory Kopf

    Let V be a symmetric monoidal closed category, and suppose that (i) K(V) is reflective in the functor category [Kopf,V], and (ii) K is cartesian closed. Then there is a symmetric monoidal closed structure on K(V) for which the category Op(K(V)) of operads in K(V) is equivalent to K(Op(V)). Furthermore, for any operad T in V, there is an operad k(T) in K(V) for which K(VT)=K(V)k(T).

    As in last week's talk, the case where V is abelian is particularly interesting; typical cases of K would now include categories, double categories, n-tuple categories, 2-categories, n-categories, and so on.

  speaker: Steve Lack

  abstract: |-
    This talked was based on old work which I recently wrote up as Limits for lax morphisms.

    It concerns limits in the 2-category of strict algebras and lax morphisms for a 2-monad. This includes both the 2-category of monoidal categories and monoidal functors as well as the 2-category of monoidal categories and opomonoidal functors. It also includes the 2-category of categories with a particular class of colimits and {\em arbitrary} functors between them.

    I showed how such 2-categories admit oplax limits, including the oplax limit of an arrow, products, and cotensor products; as well as co-Eilenberg-Moore objects (for comonads), and certain inserters, equifiers, and comma objects. (The inserters, equifiers, and comma objects in question are those for which a particular one of the arrows is not just a lax morphism but a pseudo one.)

    I described an alternative possible approach to the theory involving the horizontal double limits of Grandis and ParÃ©.

In this talk I will recall some necessary background and I will give an overview of the main ideas used in the proofs.

  speaker: Jon Cohen
  date: 2005-09-07T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    It is commonly assumed that monoidal categories entered the logical arena shortly after Girard's paper on linear logic. What is less well known is that most of what now falls under the banner of linear logic had already existed for many years in the philosophical community, under various  different names. Indeed, a fruitful exchange between Saunders Mac Lane and the proof theorist Grigori Mints led to a straightforward proof of the coherence theorem using an old logical technique applied to one of these "philosophical" logics.

    There is still much active work on the sorts of logics that Mac Lane and Mints discussed. These are collectively called "substructural" and incorporate, amongst others, linear logic. While the "flat" algebraic semantics of these logics is quite mature, relatively little has been done on the categorical front.

    I shall give a categorically phrased introduction to modern nonclassical logic, including a variety of substructural logics. Along the way, we shall see how to construct the centre of a monoidal category in a purely logical way. Several possibilities for future research will be pointed out, including a "grand challenge" for higher dimensional category theory.

  title: Comodules and coproduct decomposition
  speaker: Ross Street
  date: 2005-09-21T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: This talk was motivated by work with Brian Day on the centre (and lax centre) of a monoidal category. We simply wanted a proof, with suitable conditions on a monoidal category A, that the centre of the category AG of representations of a finite group G in  a category A is equivalent to the category AG' of functors from G' to A (where G' is the groupoid whose objects are elements of G and whose morphisms are conjugators). The proof should apply to A = Set and A = Vect. The approach was to remind the audience of Yetter-Drinfeld modules (also called crossed bimodules) for a bimonoid H in a symmetric monoidal A. In particular, such a YD-module is an H-comodule. In the case where H is the coproduct of G copies of the tensor unit in A (that is, G itself when A = Set and the group algebra of G when A = Vect), we examined H-comodules showing that for very general A they have a coproduct decomposition indexed by G. This situation was studied in detail by L. Coppey and Kelly-Pultr in the 1970s however their emphasis seemed more on the dual question of product decomposition. The question concerns the comonadicity of the functor "coproduct" from the product of G copies of A to A. Day-Lack-Street have some unpublished results about when coreflexive equalizers are always split which, together with the requirement that the coproduct coprojections be strong monomorphisms, certainly imply the comonadicity. Armed with the coproduct decomposition it is an easy matter to use the other conditions on a YD-module to turn it into a functor G' → A.

  title: Internalising the theory of weak complicial sets
  speaker: Dominic Verity
  date: 2005-10-26T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Our intuition that the theory of weak complicial sets is really some kind of weak ω-category theory leads us to hope that these structures behave as if they were quasi-categories enriched in weak complicial sets. We make this intuition precise and discuss some of the theory of these latter structures.

    Just as the theory of 2-categories is illuminated by regarding them as certain kinds of categories internal to Cat (vertically discrete double categories), it is convenient here to study the theory of quasi-categories internal to a combinatorial and complicially enriched Quillen model category. We generalise the theory of categorical discrete fibrations to this context and use it to provide motivation for a Yoneda embedding style coherence theorem which demonstrates that every weak complicial set enriched quasi-category may be replaced (up to weak equivalence) by a (strictly) enriched category.

    This latter result may be regarded as a natural generalisation of the Gordon-Power-Street coherence result relating tricategories and Gray-enriched categories.

  speaker: Michael Batanin
  date: 2006-07-26T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    It is classical that DG-categories, DG-functors and  and their complex of natural transformations can be organised in a DG-enriched 2-category. But in practice it is much more important to   consider the derived complex of   natural transformations between DG-functors. In a recent preprint Tamarkin showed that there is a "homotopy" 2-category structure on this enriched 2-graph. Precisely, he exhibited an action of a contractible 2-operad on this 2-graph.

    In this talk we will give an overview of Tamarkin's paper and also will show how  it is related to  the works of Berger/Fress, McClure/Smith and Kotsevich/Soibelman on Deligne's conjecture, Street/Day's  work on convolution structure in lax monoidal categories and Batanin's work on symmetrisation of n-operads.

    This is joint work with Clemens Berger.

  speaker: Amnon Neeman
  date: 2006-07-26T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: Let X be a projective variety. For many years now, we have known how to form an infinite completion for the derived category Db(Vect/X), whose objects are bounded complexes of vector bundles on X. This allows us to prove theorems about finite complexes of vector bundles, using infinite techniques. Only very recently have we understood how to handle the derived category Db(Coh/X), whose objects are bounded complexes of coherent sheaves on X. Krause published a paper, in 2005, showing that K(Inj/X) is an infinite completion for Db(Coh/X). Jorgensen, also in 2005, showed that, as long as X is affine, K(Proj/X) is an infinite completion for the dual category Db(Coh/X)op. Grothendieck's local duality studies conditions under which the categories Db(Coh/X) and Db(Coh/X)op are equivalent; it suffices for there to exist a "dualizing complex", and dualizing complexes exist for many interesting X. One can ask what happens to the infinite completions; it turns out that, when a dualizing complex exists, then K(Inj/X) and K(Proj/X) are also equivalent. We will discuss this, as well as related results.

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    In 1967, Gabriel and Zisman introduced the conditions needed on a class of arrows to admit a calculus of fractions. If one has a category C with a class W of weak equivalences that satisfy these conditions, the arrows in the homotopy category of fractions C[W-1] can be described as spans where the left leg is in W. This category is the universal category obtained from C by inverting the arrows in W.

    In this talk I will discuss the bicategorical generalization of this: I will discuss the conditions needed for a bicalculus of fractions and give an explicit description of the 2-cells in C[W-1], the free bicategory obtained by turning the arrows in W into equivalences. This talk is based on my paper in Compositio Mathematica from 1996, but I will discuss some minor improvements on that paper as well as ways to generalize this further to monoidal bicategories of fractions, and eventually, tricategories of fractions.

    (Joint work with Prakash Panangaden and Rick Blute)

    Segal's definition of a conformal field theory discusses "functors" for which the domain is not a category. There is an associative notion of composition or arrows, but there are no identities. Segal claim that this is not important, but we claim that one should not just freely add identities. Segal's original category can be seen as a nuclear ideal in a larger category and the functors one wants to consider as conformal field theories are nuclear functors. We will present one example of such a functor, due to Neretin.

  abstract: 'A higher rank graph is pair (Lambda,d), where Lambda is a category and d: Lambda → Nk is a functor, which satisfy a condition called the factorisation property. In this talk we show that if a category C has a functor delta :C → Nk then it can be represented as a higher rank graph. That is, there exists a universal higher rank graph denoted [C,delta] with a functor i : C → [C,delta] such that delta = di (where d is the degree map of [C,delta]). We then show conditions for when C is a full subcategory of [C,delta]. This has many applications to the study of higher rank graphs because it allows many categories with no factorisation property to still be viewed as higher rank graphs.'

  abstract: |-
    Joint work with Vincent Danos and Jean Krivine

    A distributed transaction is a computation where several agents agree on a common action. Such agents normally do not have a global view of the state space and therefore must come to agreement by local (typically one-to-one) interactions. When modelling such behaviour, it is normally straightforward to guarantee soundness – a transaction occurs only if the individual agents satisfy the correct local requirements. Completeness is often much more difficult; indeed, the existence of a possible computation leading to the required global state does not guarantee that such a state will be reached. For instance, the agents may deadlock while racing to obtain the necessary shared resources. Completeness is normally achieved by including explicit backtracking mechanisms in the model.

    We shall discuss how to model distributed transactions in such models by avoiding ad-hoc implementations of backtracking. The solution is described at a general categorical level, meaning that it can be exploited in process calculi, Petri nets and graph transformation systems alike. The  main underlying structure is a factorisation system which allows a computation to be broken up into an irreversible component followed by a reversible component. The construction is proved to be correct by exhibiting a certain equivalence of categories. In the concrete case of Petri nets, the construction can be visualised nicely by utilising string diagrams.

  abstract: Iterated monoidal categories form a categorical model of iterated loop spaces. The original paper on these structures included an intricate proof of coherence  of the "every diagram commutes" flavour. From a computational perspective,  what makes the coherence theorem nontrivial is that the      underlying term  rewriting system is non-confluent and, as such, does not enjoy unique normal  forms. We'll begin with a brief introduction to iterated monoidal categories  and use this as motivation for reducing coherence problems to questions in  term rewriting theory. Within this setting, we'll derive sufficient conditions  for the positive resolution of various coherence problems even in cases where  the rewriting system is non-confluent and/or non-terminating. With this  machinery in hand, we'll return to iterated monoidal categories and give a  more conceptual approach to their coherence problem.

    1. Introduction:   In various lectures on categorical dynamics given in 1967, Lawvere laid down the foundations of a new discipline which in recent years has undergone a rapid development and has come to be known as “synthetic differential geometry”. As the title of Lawvere’s lectures suggests the motivation came from the search for a suitable complete category theory, δ, in which to develop dynamics. Such a category, δ, unlike the category M of smooth paracompact manifolds and smooth mappings was to possess all finite limits and exponentials.

    2. Some simple questions in the calculus of variations: We look at some simple questions in the calculus of variations like: to find the shortest curve between two points on a surface or to find a closed curve of given length and maximal enclosed area, and we analyse how category theory can answer these simple questions.

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Views are important in information system design and management. The view update problem: `when can a change in a view state be extended to the total database state?' has been much studied. An early approach treated states as unstructured sets and advocated views with `constant complement', although `constant factor' would have been a better name. Recently the `lens' concept and a simple monad have elucidated the situation. A more recent order-based approach with an ordered set of states provides a generalization though still requiring complements. When states are a category of models, a less narrow view of updatability emerges.

I will talk about these developments, including results from my PhD thesis.

    Generalising modules over associative rings, the notion of  modules for an endofunctor of any category is well established and useful in large parts of mathematics including universal algebra.

    Similarly, comodules over coalgebras are the model for comodules for an endofunctor and they are of basic importance. Compatibility conditions between endofunctors can be described by  distributive laws. We use these ingredients to define (mixed) bimonads and Hopf monads on arbitrary categories thus making these notions accessible to universal algebra.

  speaker: Jon Cohen
  date: 2007-11-28T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: In a series of papers, P. Dehornoy has investigated certain algebraic invariants associated with balanced equational varieties. In general, these invariants form inverse monoids, known as "structural monoids", but particularly nice cases result in groups. Dehornoy has shown that Richard Thompson's groups F and V, each of which is finitely presentable, infinite and simple, arise as the invariants associated to the varieties of semigroups and of commutative semigroups, respectively. He subsequently obtained presentations of these groups utilising the pentagon and hexagon coherence axioms for coherently associative and commutative bifunctors. This talk will show how to systematise this observation. To every balanced equational variety E, we will associate a collection of categorifications. Each categorification yields a presentation of an inverse monoid, which is isomorphic to the structural monoid of E if and only if the categorification is coherent. The resulting presentations reflect some nice combinatorial features of the structural monoids. We may also briefly see how to extend this construction to any rewriting 2-theory, which is a Cat-enriched Lawvere theory definable by variables, with the level of detail being proportional to the time until drinks...

  abstract: |-
    In recent joint work, Bob Walters and the speaker have shown that maps (left adjoint arrows) between Frobenius objects in a cartesian bicategory ${\bf B}$ are precisely comonoid homomorphisms and, for $A$ Frobenius and any $T$ in ${\bf B}$, ${\rm map}({\bf B})(T,A)$ is a groupoid.

    In this talk, the context of the second result will be thoroughly explained and a proof given. As a corollary, it follows that a Frobenius object in the bicategory of categories and profunctors is a groupoid. This last result was first proved about 20 years ago by Aurelio Carboni and the speaker, independently. However, it is only recently that general cartesian bicategories have been defined so as to be able to contemplate the present theorem.

  abstract: I'll introduce Catalan categories, which form a coherent categorification of the theory of higher-order associativity. These structures are interesting from several perspectives but, within the context of combinatorial algebra, the main interest stems from the fact that they can be leveraged in order to obtain new presentations for the higher Thompson groups $F_{n,1}$. The coherence axioms for catalan categories directly generalise Mac Lane's axiomatisation of coherent associativity, with an extra dynamic coming into play in the higher-order case. Subsequently, I'll move onto symmetric catalan categories, which encode an action of the symmetric group. These in turn yield a presentation of the Higman-Thompson groups $G_{n,1}$ and their axiomatisation generalises Mac Lane's axioms for coherent associativity and commutativity. I'll briefly review the necessary results from my previous talk, making this talk essentially self-contained.

    joint work with Steve Lack and Bob Walters

    It is clear that Span(E), for E a category with finite limits,            is a cartesian bicategory. In this talk I will go as far as            time allows to exhibit further axioms on a cartesian B,            valid in Span(E), so as to prove  B ~ Span(E) ,            for some E with finite limits.            Since this would entail Map(B) ~ Map(Span(E)) and the latter            is well known [Carboni, Kasangian, Street, Walters, ???] to            be E, the first task at least is to show that Map(B) is a            m e r e  category with pullbacks. If every object of B is            Frobenius then, as shown last time, all the Map(B)(T,A)            are groupoids. We begin this time by showing that if every            object of B is  s e p a r a b l e  then all the            Map(B)(T,A) are ordered sets.

    Suppose that an object A in a monoidal bicategory M has a right bidual A\ring. We begin by defining an exact pairing for arrows x:A→X and y:A\ring→X in M, for X a monoidal object. We then show that the Day/Pastro theorems extend to such pairings and Frobenius arrows f:X→Y in M.

    Ultimately we apply our results in the case M=Bco, for B cartesian.

  speaker: Dominic Verity

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    It is generally held that the totality of all n-manifolds (with corners) should support a canonical weak n-categorical structure, under which all composites of cells are describable as "gluings" of manifolds along common boundary components.  At low dimensions, not only do we know that this is indeed the case, but we also know how to describe free weak 2- or 3-categories in terms of such higher categories of "cobordisms embedded in cubes".

    In this talk we describe how to build a weak complicial set (qua simplicial weak ω-category) Cob^k, whose n-simplices correspond to embeddings of manifolds of some fixed co-dimension k into the geometric n-simplex.  Here we work in the PL-category in order to avoid some of the technicalities involved when working with manifolds with corners in the smooth setting. However, it is likely that our main results bear direct translation to that latter context.

    From the point of view of the theory of weak complicial sets, Cob^k is an interesting structure for a number of reasons. Firstly, its underlying simplicial set is a Kan complex. Secondly, it possess a stratification which makes it into a weak complicial set but which is non-trivially distinct from the "all simplices are thin" structure that comes with Kan-ness. Finally, we have strong reasons to conjecture that this non-trivial complicial stratification can be extended, by making thin all simplices which are "morally" equivalences, to a complicial stratification whose thin simplices bear a characterisation in terms of simple homotopy equivalences (and which are thus s-cobordism-like).

  speaker: Boris Chorny
  date: 2008-03-19T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    The concept of smallness in homotopy theory generalizes the concept of compactness from classical topology. However, there are two possible generalizations of this notion:  one is used in the model category theory, whether the other one is used in the realm of triangulated categories. The relation between these two concepts remained subtle for a long time. Mark Hovey has shown in his book on Model categories that the smallness in a stable finitely generated category implies smallness in its homotopy category. Recently Rosicky generalized this result to combinatorial model categories.

    In this talk we will exhibit an example of a model category Quillen equivalent to the category of spaces with the following property: every homotopy type has a countably small representative. In particular, smallness in this model category does not translate into smallness in the homotopy category. Our example stems out of the work on enriched Brown representability. Connections with homotopy calculus and orthogonal calculus will also be discussed.

  speaker: Micah Blake McCurdy
  date: 2008-04-09T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    A linearly distributive category with negation can be thought of as a suitably generalised pivotal category, where the single dualising operation of a pivotal category is teased into two. Joyal and Street, in their treatment of pivotal categories, have shown that every pivotal category is equivalent to one whose dualising operation is strict; this result can be generalised to the case of linearly distributive categories with negation to produce retract equivalences between arbitrary such and "strict" ones, which have strict dualising operations, and whose de Morgan isomorphisms are identities. Furthermore, if one has lying to hand a cyclic structure on such an LDC, one can ask what conditions must be placed on it so that the obvious candidates for (one-sided) pivatal structures are, in fact, pivotal. As a pleasant complement to the previous result, which said that a cyclic structure represented a twist on a monoidal category if and only if it respected the tensor structure, here we find a pivotal structure if and only if the cyclicity respects the par structure.

We will review two descriptions of these situations, one using *equipments* and the other *double categories*, and describe their equivalence.  Then we will give several arguments for taking seriously the double-category point of view, including the definition of morphisms and adjunctions, the construction of monoids and enriched categories, and the prospects for generalization.  If time permits, we will then describe how many of these situations can be constructed in a uniform way, starting from a monoidal fibration.

The passage from categories of strict objects to categories of weak ones is fairly well understood, but the same process applied to functors still hides some mysteries.  We'll start by reviewing several notions of "derived functor" and how to describe them abstractly, and then discuss how to generalize them to an enriched situation.  The traditional context is Quillen's theory of model categories, but in fact considerably less structure suffices.  Finally, we'll apply these ideas to construct, and abstractly characterize, weighted homotopy limits.

  abstract: |-
    We generalize the work of Rosenthal who proved the following result: Let V be a complete symmetric *-autonomous category, and let X be a category enriched in V. Then the category of V-enriched profunctors from X to itself bears a cyclic *-autonomous structure which satisfies what we call ``Rosenthal's axiom', a certain coherence of the cyclic structure with the double-dualization isomorphisms.

    This result can be sharpened somewhat and thereby much better understood. Instead of working with *-autonomous structures, we work instead with linearly distributive structures with negation. If one removes the symmetry from V, replacing it with a pseudo-cyclic structure, then we can deduce that prof_V(X,X) bears a linearly distributive structure with negation which supports a pseudo-cyclic structure. Moreover, if the cyclicity of V satisfies Rosenthal's axiom, so too does prof_V(X,X). Note that a symmetric *-autonomous V can be thought of as bearing a cyclic structure (namely, the identity) which is pseudo-cyclic, pseudo-cocyclic, and moreover satisfies Rosenthal's axiom. This implies that even without weakening Rosenthal's hypotheses we can deduce that the cyclic structure on prof_V(X,X) is pseudo-cyclic and pseudo-cocyclic.

I will focus on a few of these, chiefly conditions under which Mod(H) can be shown to be a non-degenerate, non-symmetric cyclic *-autonomous category. This ties together a remark of Joyal and Street concerning pivotal categories and remarks of Blute concerning Hopf algebras with involutive antipodes, and provides a host of examples of cyclic *-autonomous categories.

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: The notions of regular localizers and homotopy sketches will be recalled. These are convenient tools to produce natural model structures on presheaf categories associated to nice monads (e.g. monads with arities and parametric right adjoint monads as considered by M. Weber). We will recover as an example  of this general process the Joyal model structure for quasi-categories and the Rezk model structure for complete Segal spaces, as well as the Quillen equivalences relating them. This also allows us to consider in the same way the homotopy theory of "quasi-n-categories" or of "quasi-multicategories" (a.k.a. dendroidal inner Kan complexes in the sense of I. Weiss and I. Moerdijk).

  title: The Tannaka-Krein reconstruction of a separable Frobenius functor is a weak Hopf algebra
  speaker: Micah Blake McCurdy
  date: 2008-10-29T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: If H is a Hopf object in a monoidal category V, then we can consider its category of representations, which comes equipped with a forgetful functor to V, in this way, one obtains a functor Hopf(V)→MonCat/V, where we take as arrows in MonCat the strong monoidal functors. One can ask if there is a left adjoint to this functor, there certainly is in the case when we restrict MonCat (and hence V) to categories having left duals, namely, Tannaka-Krein reconstruction. This talk discusses a generalization of the above to the case where H is replaced with a weak Hopf algebra and we restrict the arrows in MonCat to be the Frobenius separable ones. Existing work has focussed on the case where V = Vector Spaces and giving sufficient (and sometimes necessary) conditions for the counit of the adjunction to be an isomorphism, that is, recognising when a category is (isomorphic to) a category of representations of a Hopf algebra. There is a small novel component in the above, but the main purpose of the talk is to illustrate a graphical notation for calculations involving separable Frobenius functors, so I will be giving (graphical) proofs in more detail than normal.

  speaker: Alain Bruguières
  date: 2008-12-10T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: The talk comes in two independent parts. In the first part, I will explain how, with Steve Lack's help, we could at a single stroke simplify the definition of  Hopf monad, and extend it to arbtrary monoidal categories, and simplify the proof of the multiplicativity of the antipodes. I will also explain how this new definition can be interpreted in the case of a monoidal closed category, where being Hopf can be readily encoded in terms of 2-variable antipodes (recall that in the autonomous case we encoded it in terms of 1-variable antipodes). In the second part, I will recall the construction of the double of a Hopf monad on an autonomous category, which is based on the canonical lift of centralizers. I will apply this lifting property to fusion categories, and explain how this allows one to prove the modularity of the center of an arbitrary spherical fusion category over a ring (generalizing Mueger's modularity theorem, which concerns spherical fusion categories of invertible dimension over an algebraically closed field).

  title: Elementary definition of Restricted Entailment and some related categories
  speaker: Lee Flax
  date: 2009-02-18T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Assume that agent reasoning is done by semantic entailment: a set of sentences X entails a set of sentences Y if every semantic structure that satisfies all of X also satisfies all of Y. This presents problems for agents because they are bounded by finite resources: of computational power, time, storage capacity, etc. So semantic checking of entailment is not generally possible by a finite agent. This leads to the idea of "restricted entailment", where, by definition, semantic checking is done only over a subset of structures. (If the subset is finite and the language suitably constrained, then the restricted entailment is computable.)

    In logic, restricted entailment is defined semantically as follows. Working within a suitable universe of sets, let STRUC be the set of all semantic structures (for a given first-order language). Let W be a subset of STRUC and X a set of first-order sentences. The set of structures modW(X) is defined to be all structures belonging to W that satisfy all of X. Then "X entails Y restricted to W", denoted X|=W Y, if and only if modW(X) is a subset of modW(Y). A restricted entailment is a binary relation defined on sets of first-order sentences. This can be defined categorically in an elementary way by saying X|=W Yif and only if modW(X)>→modW(Y)>→W in the category WET. (Of course, in SET >→ is defined by means of a subobject classifier diagram.)

    There is a category SENW with a unique morphism between sets of sentences X and Y if X |=W Y; also there is a category RESENT with objects restricted entailments. There is a unique morphism from |=J to |=I iff |=J is a subset of |=I. RESENT is isomorphic to a certain category of structures FSTRUC, and SENW is equivalent to a category of structures FSTRUCW. The definition of these categories depends on the notion of "fullness" of sets of structures, which in turn depends on the relation of elementary equivalence between structures.

    Any restricted entailment |=W is a reflexive, transitive relation on the set of sentences. It defines an equivalence relation, ~, by saying that X~Y iff X|=W Y and Y |=W X. This allows a (pre-)Boolean algebra to be defined on SENW. This can be used to give an algebraic account of AGM belief revision and nonmonotonic entailment (in the context of a belief set K). The algebra can also be used to model some processes in cognitive psychology based in the work of Chris Frith, for example some signs and symptoms of Schizophrenia.

  abstract: Finite-limit, finite-sum (EA) sketches are the right syntactic structure for modelling databases and their "views". With Michael Johnson and others we have explored this observation about EA sketches for several years. In particular, the ability to express constraints and determine updatability of views both extends and considerably enhances those of the standard Entity-Relationship (ER) data model. We begin with a brief overview of these ideas. Using Java to provide portability, we have written an application that provides a user-friendly graphical design environment for EA sketches, supprots exporting a design to a database schema in SQL (the standard relational databas language), and allows data entry and manipulation. The most recent version of the application will be demonstrated.

  abstract: Bicategories, lax functors, and lax transformations do not organize themselves int a good categorical structure, the reason being that one cannot whisker (on the right) a lax transformation along a lax functor. On the other hand one can whisker a lax transformation along a pseudofunctor. Between lax functors and pseudofunctors are (separable) Frobenius functors, which we shall see are also sufficient for such whiskering.

  abstract: |-
    For the slice category C/V on a base category C with products, the sum functor sending X→V to X is a left adjoint. Algebras for the generated monad are now called "lenses". They have appeared at least three times in theoretical computer science, most recently as "update strategies" for database views. When the base category is sets the lenses are "constant complement" strategies studied in the 1980's. For ordered sets as base, the more recent work of S. Hegner is recovered. We are currently studying lenses for categories, and will discuss recent results.

    This is joint work with Michael Johnson and Richard Wood.

    We show that the model category of n-braided operads in a k-truncated symmetric monoidal model category V is Quillen equivalent to the model category of (n+1)-braided  operads if n>k+1. The Breen-Baez-Dolan stabilisation hypothesis follows from this theorem for any model of the theory of weak k-categories for which we know the existence of symmetric monoidal model structure. There are several such models in the literature and other models are expected to be, at least, equivalent to one of them.

  speaker: Micah Blake McCurdy
  date: 2009-04-01T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: 'Let F:A→B be a functor between monoidal categories. When B is braided and suitably complete or cocomplete, we construct from F an algebraic object in B, which today we write as Tan(F). Previously, we have seen that, when F is a separable Frobenius functor, Tan(F) is a weak Hopf algebra, generalizing the known result that strong such functors give rise to Hopf algebras. We pursue this notion further, cataloguing the methods by which one can obtain further structure on Tan(F) from structures on A and B. We shall discuss three such:   If A is braided then we construct a braided structure on Tan(F)   If A and B are both ribbon, then we can construct a ribbon strucure on Tan(F)    If A and B are both cyclic, then we can construct a cyclic structure on Tan(F)    The notions of 1 and 2, namely, of braided and ribbon structures, are generalizations of existing notions (with the same names) for ordinary Hopf algebras. The third notion, of a cyclic structure on a a weak bi or Hopf algebra, is new, but appears to be related to existing notions of "special grouplike elements".'

  speaker: Dominic Verity
  date: 2009-05-27T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    In the literature one can find a number of different limit notions which one might refer to as a "descent construction". Genrally speaking, these may all be regarded as a kind of lax, pseudo or homotopy limit of a cosimplicial diagram of objects in some theory of "spatially enriched" categories. While each of these notions certainly deserves to bear the descent name, it is not necessarily immediately clear how they may be related in any more specific mathematical sense.

    Recently I was asked by Urs Schreiber if I knew how a couple of these descent notions might be related formally, and so spent a little time contemplating this problem. My hope is that this talk might achieve two things, firstly I hope to provide a little of the intuition which leads us to define and study such descent constructions. Then I would like to discuss a specific answer to Urs' question, which gives a precise relationship between Ross Street's descent construction for strict ω-categories (or more precisely strict ω-groupoids in this case) and the simplicial descent construction used to characterise the fibrant objects in model categories of simplicial sheaves.

    The problem of the right generalisation of Gray-tensor product is notoriously hard. In homotopy theory an analogous status is achieved by the problem of definition of a tensor product of A_{∞}-categories (or A_{∞}-algebras). Tensor product of E_n-algebras is even more mysterious.

  title: An exactness property of T-Alg
  speaker: John Bourke
  date: 2009-06-10T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: Given a monad T on Set, many properties of the category of Sets are also true for Set^T, the Eilenberg-Moore category of algebras for the monad. Some such properties are completeness, the existence of coequalizers of equivalence relations, and the fact that equivalence relations are effective. This  talk is about 2-dimensional analogues to the above situation. T is now a 2-monad on Cat, and we are interested in T-Alg, the 2-category of strict algebras, pseudomorphisms, and the usual 2-cells. Dealing with pseudomorphisms makes T-Alg more bicategorical and less like Cat, yet T-Alg still inherits the pie limits of Cat and has all limits involving only strict morphisms. These limits are enough to define the analogues of kernel pair (higher kernel) and equivalence relation (congruence) in T-Alg, and the corresponding notion to coequalizer becomes codescent object. We will see that if a 2-monad T is strongly finitary then T-Alg has codescent objects of congruences, and congruences are effective.

  abstract: 'Hopf algebras are defined with a built in symmetry between algebra and colagebra structures, and the usual notion of morphism of Hopf algebras is similarly symmetric: namely, a moprhism which strictly preserves the units, counits, multiplications, and comultiplications. Let us call such morphisms "strong" morphisms of Hopf algebras. As Kornel Szlachanyi has pointed out, although weak Hopf algebras are also symmetrically defined, the usual notion of strong moprhism is not quite suitable when taken between weak Hopf algebras. A slight modification of the weak morphisms he suggests are useful to our purposes, specifically: We have described before a generalized Tannaka construction which takes a separable Frobenieus functor F:A→B and produces a weak Hopf algebra in B, this generalizes the known construction which takes a strong monoidal such functor and produces a Hopf algebra. It is also known that this construction provides a left adjoint tan:Aut-Strong/B → Hopf(B) to the representation functor. By extending to weak morphisms between weak Hopf algebras, we obtain another "reconstruction-representation" adjunction, between the categories SepFrob/B and weak Hopf algebras in B.'

First, I discuss a known exaqmple from Pastro and Street, namely, the category-algebra over a field which gives rise to a weak bialgebra and the groupoid-algebra which gives rise to a weak Hopf algebra. This example has a number of pleasant features, especially noting that the failure of these weak bialgebras to be bialgebras neatly matches the "failure" of the categories or groupoids to be monoids or groups, respectively.

    The basic idea of this example can be extended to deal with some weak Hopf algebras from combinatorics; in particular, there is an obvious generalization of the Grossman-Larson Hopf algebra of rooted trees to a Grossman-Larson _weak_ Hopf algebra of _coloured_ rooted trees. In fact, it appears that Grossman and Larson, who discuss coloured rooted trees in their work, carefully avoided discovering weak Hopf algebras by artificially restricting the roots of their coloured trees to not be coloured. God and time willing, I might even discuss a "shuffle weak Hopf algebra" which has objects composable sequences of morphisms in a category in place of the usual sequences of letters in an alphabet that are the objects of the shuffle Hopf algebra.

  title: Connectedness and acyclicity in string diagrams and proof nets
  speaker: Micah Blake McCurdy
  date: 2009-11-11T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Girard introduced proof nets for the multiplicative fragment of linear logic way back in the mists of time (1987); they are built up inductively from simple components, but not all "proof structures" actually represent proofs. Girard gave a recognition principle for determining these last, namely, that a certain pack of derived graphs be connected and acyclic.

    Ross Street and I wrote a paper recently where we discussed labelling string diagrams in monoidal categories, and then considered "varying" the labelling along a Frobenius monoidal functor F. There are two obvious such "varyings", when they coincide, we say that the string diagram is F-invariant. A key result in the aforementioned paper is that a string diagram is F-invariant for all Frobenius monoidal functors if and only if it is connected and acyclic.

    Robin Cockett pointed out some time ago taht specializing a linear functor between linearly distributive categories to the case where both categories have equal tensor and par produces a Frobenius monoial functor between monoidal categories. Seeing as linearly distributive categories are, by design, categorical models of the multiplicative fragment of linear logic, and string diagrams can be thought of as simple proof nets, it is tantalizing to think that the coincidence of the condition "connected and acyclic" is more than just a coincidence.

    In the end, it is essentially a coincidence, as I will show; but the path to discover this gives generalizations of the results of M and Street which are themselves interesting.

  abstract: 'One of the central open problems of higher category theory is to describe the higher dimensional analogues of the Gray tensor product of 2-categories, as part of an inductive machine that would provide a definition of "semi-strict n-category". If we ignore al information on 2-cells in the Gray tensor product on 2-Cat, we get a well-known product on Cat. This is frequently called the "funny tensor product". In this talk I''ll explain why the funny tensor product is a very general phenomenon: there is an analogous tensor product for any higher dimensional structure definable by a "normalized" n-operad in the sense of Batanin.'

  title: Natural weak factorization systems in model structures
  speaker: Emily Riehl
  date: 2009-12-02T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Factorization systems abound in mathematics: orthogonal factorization systems (ofs) have nice categorical properties but are too strict to describe many homotopical situations, while weak factorization systems (wfs) do figure prominently, especially in the definition of a model structure on a category, but aren't as well behaved. Natural weak factorization systems (nwfs) "algebraicize" the notion of wfs and sit somewhere in between the two, and thanks to Richard Garner's small object argument, it's possible to construct a plethora of examples.
    My work explores the consequences of incorporating nwfs into model categories: a natural model structure will consist of a pair of nwfs together with a comparison map between them such that the underlying classes of maps form a model structure in the ordinary sense. After giving the basic definitions and exploring some of the properties of nwfs, I'll devote the remainder of the talk to persuading my audience that this was a good idea. The most significant results build toward an algebraization of the notion of a Quillen adjunction, each of which include five adjunctions of nwfs. In addition to supplying the definition, I am able to show that this extra algebraic structure can be found for a large family of known examples of Quillen adjunctions.

  speaker: Gabriella Böhm
  date: 2010-02-03T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: A weak mixed distributive law in a 2-category consists of a monad t and a comonad c together with a 2-cell tc → ct relating both structures. The axioms are obtained from those of a mixed distributive law by weakening the compatibility conditions with the (co)unit of the (co)monad. In contrast to a mixed distributive law, the weak generalization is not known to be a (co)monad in any 2-category. We show, however, that it can be described as a compatible pair of a comonad in a 2-category extending the 2-category of monads, and a monad in a 2-category extending the 2-category of comonads. This observation is used to construct a 2-category in which the objects are the weak mixed distributive laws. A mixed distributive law is shown to induce a weak lifting of the involved monad t to the Eilenberg-Moore category of the comonad c and also a weak lifting of c to the Eilenberg-Moore category of t. These weakly lifted monad and comonad are proven to possess equivalent Eilenberg-Moore objects.

  speaker: Micah Blake McCurdy

  abstract: If V is a cyclic linearly distributive category (for instance, if it is a cyclic monoidal category) then V-categories, V-profunctors, and modulations of profunctors form another cyclic structure, namely, a cyclic linear bicategory. The same cannot be said for, say, braiding or symmetry, showing that cyclicity appears to be the correct notion of commutativity for this construction. Pursuing yet further generalizations, the cyclic linearly distributive V can be replaced with a cyclic linear bicategory W, and certain completeness assumptions on V/W can be discarded if we content ourselves with obtaining a cyclic polybicategory V-Prof instead of a cyclic linear bicategory.

    Solving the "view update problem" for database updates interpreted as processes requires what have been called "translations". From this perspective, the view update problem can be seen as a lifting problem. Thus it is not surprising that fibrations play a role.

    We have studied view definitions with "lens" structure, They are essentially projections and do provide translations. When C = Cat a lens G:S→V is an opfibration. On the other hand, taking the projection (G,1_V) → V from the comma category is the functor part of a monad on Cat/V. An algebra for (-,1_V) (an opfibration) provides a good notion of a generalized lens. Furthermore, an opfibration has "universal translations". These provide a universal solution to the view updating problem when G = W*:Mod(E) → Mod(V) for a view (sketch morphism) W:V→E in the Sketch Data Model.

  speaker: Micah Blake McCurdy

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    We tenuously connect three results:

    1) Jeff Egger has developed a construction of functor categories
    between star-autonomous categories which specialises to cover
    linearly-distributive categories in some cases.

    2) Craig Pastro and Ross Street have shown that, for F a separable
    frobenius monoid in a braided monoidal category, there is a weak
    bialgebra structure on the tensor product of F with itself.

    3) In my thesis, I show that every separable Frobenius monoidal
    functor gives rise to a weak-bialgebra in its codomain.

    Modulo some technical wrinkles which we will discuss, it appears as
    though the Tannaka construction of 3) can be obtained as a composite
    of processes 1) and 2).

  title: The universal Chern character and a non-commutative Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem
  speaker: Denis-Charles Cisinski
  date: 2011-06-01T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    This is joint work with G. Tabuada.

    There is a universal functor from the homotopy category of dg(=differential graded) categories to a stable homotopy theory with the following properties: it inverts derived Morita equivalences, it preserves filtrered homotopy colimits, and sends Drinfeld quotients (aka the dg analogs of Verdier quotients of triangulated categories) to homotopy cofibers. The universal Chern character theorem states that the (derived) Hom's in this target category computes non-connective K-theory (i.e., in positive degrees, we get back Quillen-Waldhausen K-theory, while, in negative degrees, we obtain Bass negative K-groups). Moreover, this universal functor is symmetric monoidal, from which we get a Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula for smooth and proper dg categories.

    My aim in these talks is to discuss the homotopy coherence properties of adjunctions between quasi-categories. Much of what I will say will be expository in nature, but I hope that my ramblings will culminate in a simple and fully explicit description of the quasi-categorically enriched category containing the generic such adjunction. I also hope to sketch a proof that this structure does indeed possesses the universal property expected of such a beast.

    This is joint work with my dear friend Dr Emily Riehl of Harvard.

    A catead in a finitely complete 2-category K is an internal category whose source-target span is a two-sided discrete fibration. Cateads were named and studied by Bourn and Penon in their preprint "2-Catégories réductibles" (now a TAC reprint).

    We show that cateads in the finitely complete K are precisely those internal categories whose externalisation (K_0)^op → Cat extends to a 2-functor K^op → Cat. We deduce that the 2-category Kat(K) of cateads, internal functors and internal natural transformations, is an exact completion of K: the closure of the representables  in [K^op, Cat] under finite limits and codescent objects of cateads.

In population biology and the study of infectious diseases, "stochastic Petri nets" are sometimes used for the same purpose.   In fact chemical reaction networks and stochastic Petri nets are essentially the same thing.  The theory of symmetric monoidal categories can help us understand what this thing is, and how to work with it.

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    This series of talks will give a thorough going-through of notions of regularity for 2-categories, making use of the theory of lex colimits developed with Steve Lack. Three notions of regularity will be considered, which respectively generalise to any suitable 2-category the (so, ioff), (bo, ff) and (bofull, faithful) factorisation systems on Cat. The main technical trick is to figure out the necessary exactness conditions by the requirement that there should exist a full structure preserving embedding into a sheaf 2-category (lex-reflective subcategory of a presheaf 2-category).

    This is joint work with John Bourke.

It is used to provide the combinatorial objects which enable one to organise better various colimit calculations arising in operad theory, such as the computation of free operads of various kinds or the calculation of colimits in the category of algebras of a given operad.

    We describe the free completion of a 2-category under quotients of mixed cateads; these last being the notion of "equivalence relation" appropriate to the (surjective on objects, injective on objects fully faithful) factorisation system on Cat or on any so-regular 2-category.

    This is joint work with John Bourke.

    We explain an observation of Mike Shulman's; it shows how one can obtain the equipment Cat → Prof as a free cocompletion in the world of bicategories enriched over a particular monoidal bicategory F. This F has as objects, arrows A →
    C from a discrete category to a cocomplete one, and as arrows, pseudocommutative squares. An F-bicategory is a category A with a pseudofunctor A → C into a locally cocomplete bicategory (and
    composition preserving colimits in each variable). The free cocompletion yielding Cat → Prof is that of 1 → Sigma(Set) with respect to tight coproducts and tight Kleisli objects. Various generalisations are discussed.

    It's well-known that strict n-categories have an easy inductive definition via iterated enrichment:

    Strict-(n+1)-Cat = (Strict-n-Cat, ×)-Cat.

    In this talk the operads for weak n-categories with strict units will be described, and from them the theory of multitensors will be used to construct a "tensor product" T(n) on the category W(n) of weak
    n-categories with strict units, giving a similar inductive formulation for such structures:

    W(n+1) = (W(n),T(n))-Cat.

Given a natural number n, we define a category of simplicial objects in V, called n-stacks, and prove that they form a category of fibrant objects. We then discuss the Dwyer-Kan simplicial localization of the category of n-stacks with respect to weak equivalences.

    In these talks I hope to present a new proof of the Beck monadicity theorem for quasi-categories. In the process I shall re-present the foundations of elementary quasi-category theory in a more "Antipodean" style. My ultimate goal will be to convince you that the Beck monadicity theorem may be expressed as an almost completely formal result regarding the combinatorics of the generic adjunction simplicial category (on which topic I spoke earlier in the year).

  abstract: |-
    In this talk we consider the problem of representing and reasoning about systems, especially probabilistic systems, with hidden state.  We consider transition systems where the state is not completely visible to an outside observer.  Instead, there are observables that partly identify the state. We show that one can interchange the notions of state and observation and obtain what we call a dual system.  The double dual gives a minimal representation of the behaviour of the original system.  We extend this to nondeterministic systems and to probabilistic transition systems and finally to partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs).  In the case of finite automata restricted to one observable, we obtain Brzozowski's algorithm for minimizing finite-state language acceptors.  I will explain the category theoretic reason why this works at the end.  In this more general version we can handle weighted automata and also probabilistic transition systems.

    This research began with joint work with colleagues from McGill especially Doina Precup and Chris Hunt.  The recent categorical understanding is joint work with Clemens Kupke and Nick Bezhanishvili.

    We give a unified account of quantum non-locality and contextuality in sheaf-theoretic terms.
    The existence of local hidden variable models is shown to be equivalent to the existence of global sections.
    Bell's theorem and related results amount to showing that there are obstructions to global sections in the probability models arising from quantum mechanics.
    We also discuss how sheaf cohomology can be used to characterise these obstructions.

  title: The Geometry of Quantum and Classical Information
  speaker: Jamie Vicary
  date: 2013-04-10T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: Flows of quantum and classical information have a hidden geometrical structure, with processes, systems and correlations described by points, lines and surfaces. The resulting algebraic structures are naturally described using symmetric monoidal bicategories, with the requirement for the information flows to be well-behaved giving rise to dualizability conditions on the n-cells. Our approach allows a variety of quantum and classical protocols to be defined by equations between surface diagrams, such that implementations of these protocols are solutions to these equations in appropriate 2-categories. The choice of 2-category then determines the 'model of computation', or 'theory of physics', in which you would like to work. The approach can be applied to classical encryption, classical secret sharing, quantum teleportation, quantum dense coding, complementary observables and quantum erasure. The bicategorical approach unifies all of these structures, showing them all to be examples of a single, simple algebraic object.

  abstract: Since its original statement in 'Homotopical Algebra' (Quillen, 1967), the small object argument has been generalised in several ways. Quite often, its improvement cares about the question of being small in the category where it is applied. An easy way to start with is to suppose that the category is locally presentable. Then, rather than considering a global assumption on the structure of the category, it is possible to generalise the argument by only looking at a certain collection of 'small' objects. But again, the condition of being small may be generalised by considering various sets of parameters providing the objects with various properties. In this talk, I will look at two notions of smallness, the original one, used by Quillen in his book, and a slight modification of it whose particular property is to be 'more adapted' to the study of homotopy (co)limits.

  abstract: 'Many invariants of size in mathematics - from cardinality to Euler characteristic to (conjecturally) geometric measure - are tied together by the notion of the magnitude of an enriched category.  I will give a brief overview of the big picture, before concentrating on one hitherto neglected part of it: the magnitude of a graph.  This invariant assigns to each graph a rational function.  Not much is known about it yet; in some ways it resembles the Tutte polynomial, but it can distinguish certain graphs that the Tutte polynomial cannot.  This is work in progress, with important contributions from David Speyer and Simon Willerton'

  abstract: |-
    We explain that the BRST complex of closed string field theory is an algebra over the bar construction (called in this context the Feynman transform) of the modular envelope of the operad Com for commutative associative algebras. This algebraic structure is sometimes called a loop or quantum homotopy Lie algebra.

    We then discuss an analogous result for open strings. Here the central problem lies already in describing the modular envelope of the operad Ass for associative algebras. We show that this task has an interesting geometric content related to the cow's stomach.

  title: On Hopf monoids in duoidal categories
  speaker: Gabriella Böhm
  date: 2013-12-04T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Duoidal categories (under the original name `2-monoidal category') were introduced by Aguiar and Mahajan. These are pseudomonoids in the Cartesian monoidal 2-category of monoidal categories – (op)lax monoidal functors – (op)lax monoidal natural transformations. Hence they are categories with two related monoidal structures. A bimonoid in a duoidal category is an object of the category carrying the structures of a monoid with respect to the first monoidal product and a comonoid with respect to the second monoidal product. The compatibility conditions are formulated in terms of the coherence morphisms relating both monoidal structures.

    In this talk we shall compare the various principles that can be used to define a bimonoid with some additional `Hopf' property.

    The talk is based on joint results with Yuanyuan Chen and Liangyun Zhang and a most recent work in progress with Steve Lack.

    Moment categories are equipped with a system of split idempotent
    endomorphisms, called moments, such that each morphism is fixed by a
    well-determined target moment.

    Each moment category of finite type defines a specific type of operad
    which records the combinatorics of partitioning moments into elementary
    ones. In this way the notions of symmetric, non-symmetric and
    n-operad correspond to moment structures on Gamma (Segal), Delta
    (Eilenberg) and Θ_n (Joyal) respectively.

  speaker: Paul Slevin
  date: 2014-12-17T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Recently, distributive laws have been used by Böhm and Stefan to
    construct new examples of duplicial (paracyclic) objects, and hence
    cyclic homology theories. The paradigmatic example of such a theory is
    the cyclic homology HC(A) of an associative algebra A. It was observed
    by Kustermans, Murphy, and Tuset that the functor HC can be twisted by
    automorphisms of A. It turns out that this twisting procedure can be
    applied to any duplicial object defined by a distributive law.

    I will begin by defining duplicial objects and cyclic homology, as well
    as discussing some categorical concepts, then describe the construction
    of Böhm and Stefan. I will then define the category of factorisations of
    a distributive law and explain how this acts on their construction, and
    give some examples, making explicit how the action of this category
    generalises the twisting of an associative algebra.

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: Motivated by a ``monoidal Yoneda's lemma'' we will study formal category theory in a ``double-dimensional'' setting. More precisely, where usually a 2-category is taken as setting, we instead take an ``(fc, bl)-multicategory'' as setting. The latter notion extends slightly that of fc-multicategory (aka virtual double category). After having introduced (fc, bl)-multicategories, in this first talk we consider their basic theory.

On the other hand, restriction categories have been less well-studied (as they were only introduced in the 1990's). In this talk, we give an analogue of free cocompletion within the restriction setting by introducing the notion of restriction presheaf.

  abstract: 'Given a locally cartesian closed regular category E, we may form the bicategories of relations, spans and polynomials. In this talk, we will first use the local reflections between the bicategories of relations and spans to derive the universal property of relations from that of spans. We will then proceed by proving our main result: that the inclusion of spans into polynomials has a right adjoint in the 2-category of bicategories, lax functors and icons; which exhibits Span(E) as a locally coreflective sub-bicategory of Poly(E).'

  date: 2016-07-06T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Dosen and Petric, following earlier work of Devadoss and others, have used hypergraphs to describe a class of polytopes lying between the permutohedron and the simplex, obtained by successive truncations of faces of the latter (at all dimensions). The key notion is that of constructs, which are combinatorial structures derived from the structure of the hypergraph under study and describe all the faces of an abstract polytope. We present a handy notation for them.

    Just like associahedra arise in the coherence of monoidal categories, several polytopes (the associahedron, the permutohedron, and a third one, called hemi-associahedron) intervene in the investigation of the notion of weak Cat-operad (in which the two kinds of operadic associativities - the sequential and the parallel one - are weakened to be coherent isomorphisms). The situation for weak cyclic operads is currently under investigation.

  speaker: Christopher Nguyen

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: A parity structure is a name given to various ways of formalising the idea of pasting diagrams, among these are; parity complexes (Street), pasting schemes (Johnson), and directed complexes (Steiner). Roughly speaking, the intuition behind these formalisms is to take a polytope-like object and attach orientation in a special way to obtain a presentation of a free ω category. Although these formalisms are powerful enough to capture the main examples (globes, simplexes and cubes), they tend to be too restrictive to cover various other examples. An example of interest is the associahedra, for which I have constructed an orientation which is not a parity complex. Nevertheless I am able to show the associahedra satisfy a weaker set of axioms, furthermore this set of axioms still gives a presentation for a free ω category. I will introduce a new kind of parity structure called label structures, which turns out to be useful for proving these axioms.

  abstract: |-
    Hypergraph categories are symmetric monoidal categories in which every object is equipped with a special commutative Frobenius monoid (with a coherence condition). Morphisms in a hypergraph category can hence be represented by string diagrams in which strings can branch and split: diagrams (hypergraphs) that are reminiscent of electrical circuit diagrams. As such they provide a framework for formalising the syntax and semantics of circuit-type diagrammatic languages.

    In this talk I will introduce decorated corelations as a tool for building hypergraph categories and hypergraph functors. We shall see that all hypergraph categories and hypergraph functors can be constructed in this way.

  abstract: |-
    (joint work with Joachim Kock – report on arXiv1609.03276)

    For any coloured operad R, we prove a Faa di Bruno formula for the 'connected Green function' in the incidence bialgebra of R. This generalises on one hand the classical Faa di Bruno formula (dual to composition of power series), corresponding to the case where R is the terminal reduced operad, and on the other hand the Faa di Bruno formula for P-trees of Galvez-Kock-Tonks (P a finitary polynomial endofunctor), which corresponds to the case where R is the free operad on P. Following Galvez-Kock-Tonks, we work at the objective level of groupoid slices, hence all proofs are 'bijective': the formula is established as the homotopy cardinality of an explicit equivalence of groupoids, in turn derived from a certain two-sided bar construction. In fact we establish the formula more generally in a relative situation, for algebras for one polynomial monad internal to another. This covers in particular nonsymmetric operads (for which the terminal reduced case yields the noncommutative Faa di Bruno formula of Brouder-Frabetti-Krattenthaler).

  speaker: Steve Lack
  date: 2017-02-01T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    I defined a notion of braiding for a skew monoidal category, generalizing the usual notion for monoidal categories, and involving isomorphisms (XA)B→(XB)A. In the case where the left unit maps IA→A are invertible, one can take X=I and so obtain an isomorphism AB→ BA, but in general this may not be possible.

    One example is the category of categories with chosen finite limits, and functors which strictly preserve them. This has a skew closed structure for which the internal hom [A,B] consists of the functors which preserve finite limits in the usual sense. There is a corresponding tensor product, and this the resulting skew monoidal category has a braiding in our sense. There are many related examples where the structure of finite limits is replaced by some other "commutative" structure.

    Another example involves bialgebras. Given a bialgebra B, there is an induced skew monoidal structure on Vect, with the tensor product of V and W given by the usual tensor product VBW. Braidings on this skew monoidal category correspond to quasitriangular structures on B.

    This is joint work with John Bourke.

  speaker: Emily Riehl
  date: 2017-02-08T16:00:00.000Z

  abstract: |-
    A Reedy category (in the sense of Berger and Moerdijk, generalizing Kan's generalization of arguments due to Reedy for the category Delta) is a small category together with an assignment of a natural number degree to each of its objects together with designated subcategories of "degree-increasing" and "degree-decreasing" maps satisfying certain axioms. These axioms permit inductive specifications of the data of an object or morphism in the category of Reedy-indexed diagrams. In particular, these inductive arguments can be used to construct a Quillen model structure on the category of Reedy diagrams relative to any model structure on the target category, which can then be used to study homotopy limits or colimits of Reedy shape.

    This expository talk will follow an expository paper joint with Verity that highlights the essential common feature of these inductive arguments. The Reedy axioms give rise to a canonical presentation of the hom bifunctor for any Reedy category, considered as a profunctor from that Reedy category to itself, as a cell complex whose cells are built from boundaries of representable functors. This structure is then transferred to generic Reedy diagrams by taking weighted limits or weighted colimits. Part II of this talk will consider the extension of these results from the strict Reedy case to the general one from the perspective of algebraic weak factorization systems.

  abstract: 'A natural question to ask for diagrams of a fixed shape valued in a model category is: when is the (weighted) colimit or limit functor invariant under weak equivalences? When this is the case, the strict (co)limit is referred to as a "homotopy (co)limit." In the case where the indexing category is a strict Reedy category, we present a notion of "Reedy cofibrant" diagrams and weights for which the strict weighted colimits are homotopy colimits. To illustrate this theory in practice, we then work out explicit characterizations of these Reedy cofibrant diagrams in the case of pushouts, coequalizers, sequential colimits, and geometric realizations.'

  abstract: |-
    In the category of simplicial sets every map is exponentiable (or powerful), in the sense that pullback along such maps admits a right adjoint, sometimes called "push-forward" or "fibred product". Restricting our attention to the theory of quasi-categories, it is natural to study the conditions under which this push-forward functor is quasi-categorically well behaved (in some sense). Two results of this kind are absolutely indispensable in many applications of quasi-categories. These show that any cocartesian fibration of quasi-categories is powerful, in the sense that push-forward along it preserves isofibrations and cartesian fibrations of quasi-categories.

    These results were originally established by Lurie, and he frames them as model category theoretic results. In this talk we seek to re-frame those results in more elementary terms. Our hope is that by doing so we might throw further conceptual light on some important themes and link them back more clearly to corresponding approaches in the categorical literature.

    As this talk will explain, the "algebraic" aspects of the theory of Reedy categories very closely parallel the better known case of strict Reedy categories, described in the previous talks in this series, while the "homotopical" aspects are somewhat more complicated. In particular, we will introduce three notions of Reedy (algebraic) weak factorization system, and discuss their competing merits.

  title: Coherence for skew monoidal categories, revisited
  speaker: Steve Lack
  date: 2017-03-08T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    After recalling Kelly's notion of club over N, and its correspondence with plane Cat-operads, I talked about the club/operad for skew monoidal categories, which was constructed in the Lack-Street paper Coherence for skew monoidal categories [Advances, 2014]. This described the free skew monoidal category generated by an object, and proved that it had a faithful structure-preserving map to the (skew monoidal) category of non-empty finite ordinals and order-and-bottom-preserving maps.

    In the paper, the image of this functor was not described as explicitly as one might hope for. In the talk, I described
    how to make this completely explicit.

    This is joint work with John Bourke, motivated by our on-going investigations into a multicategorical approach to
    skew monoidal categories

    The associahedra are a family of polytopes discovered independently by Tamari and Stasheff. Many models
    are known; some geometric, some combinatorial.

    The vertices correspond to all complete bracketings of an n-fold product, for some given n. The higher-dimensional faces can then be seen as partial bracketings.

    A particular attractive model for the vertices is the left bracketing functions (LBFs) of Huang and Tamari. In his thesis, Christopher Nguyen describes the more general higher left bracketing functions (HLBFs), which can be used to describe all the faces.

    In this talk I gave an alternative model, in which a face is specified by a pair of LBFs, subject to certain conditions.

We will give a purely geometric description for this calculus and, using the Cobordism Hypothesis, show every compact category admits a graphical calculus in a coherent way so that we can extend it to the higher contexts.

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: If homotopy type theory describes a "synthetic theory of ∞-groupoids" is there a similar directed type theory that describes a "synthetic theory of ∞-categories"? In joint work with Mike Shulman, we propose foundations for such a theory motivated by the model of homotopy type theory in the category of Reedy fibrant simplicial spaces, which contains as a full subcategory the ∞-cosmos of Rezk spaces, a framework for synthetic ∞-category theory developed in joint work with Verity. We introduce simplices and cofibrations into homotopy type theory to probe the internal categorical structure of types, and define Segal types, in which binary composites exist uniquely up to homotopy, and Rezk types, in which the categorical isomorphisms are additionally equivalent to the type-theoretic identities - a "local univalence" condition. In the model these correspond exactly to the Segal and Rezk spaces. We then demonstrate that these simple definitions suffice to develop the synthetic theory of ∞-categories, including functors, natural transformations, co- and contravariant type families with discrete fibers (∞-groupoids), a "dependent" Yoneda lemma that looks like "directed identity-elimination," and the theory of coherent adjunctions.

Then I will discuss categorical g-representations, for any semi simple Lie algebra g, and the appearance of these structures in some of my own work related to Schubert varieties in the affine Grassmannian. If there is time, I would like to also discuss some open problems in this area that I think will require tools from higher category theory.

  title: Doubly degenerate Trimble 3-categories and braided monoidal categories
  speaker: Eugenia Cheng
  date: 2017-08-16T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Trimble's approach to defining weak $n$-categories is by iterated enrichment, where each stage of enrichment is parametrised by the action of an operad. For some time it was thought that this definition would be ``too strict' because although associativity and units are made weak, interchange remains strict. However, work by Joyal and Kock has shown that an alternative strictification to the usual one is possible: interchange can be made strict if units and associativity are not. Specifically, they proved that, given any monoidal 2-category with this level of weakness, End(I) is a braided monoidal category, and that every braided monoidal category arises in this way, up to some suitable equivalence.

    We will give an analogous comparison for doubly degenerate Trimble 3-categories. We will construct a comparison functor to braided monoidal categories inspired by Joyal and Kock's use of cliques, and show that every braided monoidal category arises in this way, up to a suitable notion of equivalence. There is a difficulty in that notion of equivalence, as Trimble's original definition cleverly sidesteps the issue of weak functors, whereas we will need it. Thus we also propose a definition of weak functor for doubly degenerate Trimble 3-categories, based on the work of Cheng and Gurksi showing that an approach using icons gives the right higher maps between degenerate n-categories. Using these weak functors we construct a 2-category of doubly degenerate Trimble 3-categories and give a sense in which this is 2-equivalent to a 2-category of braided monoidal categories.

  abstract: |-
    The theory of homotopical algebraic geometry, or ∞-stacks, hinges on a certain Quillen model structure on the category of simplicial presheaves over a Grothendieck site. The goal of augmented homotopical algebraic geometry is to study the result of replacing the simplex category in this theory with a suitable, more exotic category.

    In the first of what will probably constitute a couple of talks, we will introduce the notion of an augmentation category. The definition of an
    augmentation category gives sufficient conditions for when we can equip the category of "augmented presheaves" with a Quillen model structure which has a Quillen restriction to the category of ∞-stacks. We will show that when our site is the category of derived affine schemes, it is possible to construct n-Deligne-Mumford (or n-Artin) augmented derived stacks by using a modified hypergroupoid construction.

    In the sequel(s), we will explore some examples of augmentation categories, and discuss what the "augmentation" is achieving with regards to the geometry over certain sites

Moreover, using the cyclic nerve construction, we can define an equivariant version of the derived stack of local systems, which is a canonical example of 1-Artin derived stack.

    Next, we will look at the dendroidal category, and see what the Kan model structure on dendroidal sets should be thought of geometrically. Finally, we combine these two examples with a categorical amalgamation construction forming a new augmentation category.

  speaker: Alexander Campbell
  date: 2017-10-11T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Back in March, we saw that the strictification adjunction (between the category of 2-categories and 2-functors and the category of bicategories and pseudofunctors) can be enriched to an adjunction between categories (strictly!) enriched over the symmetric closed multicategory of bicategories (introduced in Verity's PhD thesis). Six months later, we revisit this topic to show that the strictification of indexed bicategories (i.e. bicategory-valued trihomomorphisms) forms a biadjunction between bicategories enriched over the Gray–Verity-style symmetric closed 2-multicategory of pseudo double categories, and hence a triadjunction between tricategories (a la Garner–Gurski on locally cubical bicategories).

    This week, we will review the original strictification adjunction and show that its enrichment follows formally from its structure as an adjunction between closed multicategories. Furthermore, we will recover Gurski's "[pseudo]monoidal structure of strictification" from the observations that the strictification adjunction extends moreover to an adjunction between 2-multicategories (whose 2-cells are multivariable icons), and that the 2-multicategory structure on Bicat is birepresented (i.e. represented up to equivalence) by the cartesian product of bicategories. At various points, our categorical instincts and our desire for best-possible results will lead us to thoughts of enrichment over pseudo double categories, to which we will succumb next time.

  abstract: The recursive realizability interpretation of constructive logic, first developed by S.C. Kleene and encoded in topos-theoretic form in the late 1970s by Martin Hyland, is only one of a large range of weird and wonderful toposes which can be constructed in the same way from simple algebraic structures known as Schonfinkel algebras (or partial combinatory algebras). In this talk I'll describe the construction and indicate something of the range of different examples available; subsequent talks will be devoted to investigating how they fit together into a 2-category.

The first serious steps in this direction were taken by John Longley in his Edinburgh PhD thesis (1994), but the final piece of the jigsaw was fitted into place only in 2013. In this talk I'll trace the development of our understanding.

  title: Strictification of indexed bicategories
  speaker: Alexander Campbell
  date: 2017-11-01T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    A quirk of bicategory theory is that the relation of isomorphism between objects in a bicategory is poorly behaved: it is neither reflexive nor transitive. For this reason, if one wants to work "as strictly as possible" when studying bicategories it is sometimes convenient to work with the more general pseudo double categories, which have an extra class of "vertical" morphisms which compose strictly associatively. Thus Garner and Gurski introduced the notion of "locally cubical bicategory" (that is, a bicategory enriched in the cartesian monoidal 2-category PsDblCat of pseudo double categories) to capture those three dimensional categories in which composition ought to be associative up to isomorphism (rather than merely up to equivalence, as in a tricategory), and showed that a locally cubical bicategory whose homs are "fibrant" gives rise to a tricategory. Similarly, Shulman showed that many symmetric monoidal bicategories of interest arise from symmetric monoidal fibrant pseudo double categories (in which the tensor product is associative up to vertical isomorphism).

    In this talk we will show that the tricategory Hom(A,Bicat) of indexed bicategories over a Gray-category A (that is, the tricategory of trihomomorphisms A → Bicat) arises from a locally cubical bicategory, whose vertical 2-cells are icon-component trimodifications ("tricons"), and that the pointwise strictification trihomomorphism from Hom(A,Bicat) to the Gray-category Hom(A,Gray) arises from a PsDblCat-enriched pseudofunctor, which is the left biadjoint of a PsDblCat-enriched biadjunction.

  title: Symmetric lenses, cospans and universality
  speaker: Bob Rosebrugh
  date: 2017-11-08T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: A lens between two domains of model states is one type of so-called bidirectional transformation (BX). A symmetric lens has both data for state synchronization and operations to restore synchronization post state change. An asymmetric lens has only one-way data and operations. When the domains of model states are categories, the lenses are called d-lenses. The synchronization data for an asymmetric d-lens is a functor. In the special case that we named (asymmetric) c-lenses the restoration operation satisfies a universal property. This makes a c-lens what the BX community calls `least change' (and makes the synchronization functor exactly a split op-fibration). Some time ago we showed that spans of asymmetric d-lenses precisely represent symmetric d-lenses and their composition. Recently, motivated by applications to database interoperation, we have also considered cospans of asymmetric d-lenses. These cospans represent certain symmetric d-lenses and we characterize the symmetric d-lenses which so arise. When the cospan's legs are c-lenses then the symmetric d-lens has a universal-like property. (Joint work with Michael Johnson.)

  date: 2017-11-15T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: Among the many variants of the realizability interpretation of constructive logic, modified realizability (first introduced by Georg Kreisel in 1959) has received less than its share of attention from topos-theorists. Previous work (Grayson 1981, Hyland and Ong 1993, van Oosten 1997) has largely concentrated on particular algebras such as the Kleene algebra, and has not addressed the question of how to define modified realizability over an arbitrary Sch"onfinkel algebra. In this talk I'll introduce the notion of `right pseudo- ideal' in a Sch"onfinkel algebra, and show that these suffice to define modified realizability toposes; to the extent that time permits, I'll also discuss the functoriality of the construction – i.e., when do morphisms of Sch"onfinkel algebras induce geometric morphisms between modified realizability toposes?

    This is step zero in a project to understand (co)localisation of model categories from a perspective which does not make use of Smith's theorem, but only the constructions of lifting of model structures along right and left adjoint functors.

    It is only step zero, because we only fulfil it here for model structures enriched over the model category of 0-types; that is, ones for which the liftings involved in a model structure are unique. Despite being homotopically trivial, it turns out that there are mathematically meaningful examples of such model structures arising in algebraic geometry.

    This is joint work with Scott Balchin.

  abstract: The theory of (infinity, 1)-categories can be seen as an abstract framework for homotopy theory which emerged from classical category theory and algebraic topology. Homotopy Type Theory is a formal language originating from logic which can also be used to argue about homotopy theory. It is believed that HoTT is an "internal language" of (infinity, 1)-categories. Roughly speaking, this means that HoTT and higher category theory prove the same theorems. Even making this statement precise is challenging and leads to a range of conjectures of varying scope and depth. In this talk, I will discuss a proof of the simplest of these conjectures obtained recently in joint work with Chris Kapulkin.

    Often, one can transfer a (cofibrantly-generated) model structure by lifting fibrations and weak equivalences along a right adjoint. We give a concise sufficient condition for lifted model structures to exist when the right adjoint has a right adjoint of its own.

    This condition applies to give model structures on
    * simplicially-enriched categories equipped with an anti-involution, and
    * simplicial sets equipped with an anti-involution
    lifted from the Bergner and Joyal model structures, respectively. Moreover, the usual Quillen equivalence between these lifts to this setting.

  abstract: 'In his seminal 2007 paper `Axiomatic cohesion'', Bill Lawvere introduced a notion of `weak generation'' of a topos by a family of objects, and showed that at least one simple model of `sufficient cohesion'' is weakly generated by an object which is infinitesimal in the sense of Penon (i.e., its associated not-not-sheaf is 1). Recently, Matias Menni produced an ingenious argument which shows that this condition holds in all models of sufficient cohesion; but he failed to notice a much stronger result, namely that it holds in all toposes which are perfect in the sense of Freyd. Recently I noticed that the converse also holds: that is, weak generation by infinitesimals is equivalent to perfectness.'

    (joint work with Murray Bremner)

    Experience teaches us that the most common classes of algebras are the Three Graces - associative, commutative associative, and Lie - together with other that combine these in a specific way. The most prominent example of a combined structure are Poisson algebras which are combinations of Lie and commutative associative algebras by means of a quadratic homogeneous distributive law.

    Our aim was to investigate whether the commonly known combinations of the Three Graces are the only possible ones via such a distributive law. The answer turned out, rather surprisingly, no.

    In my talk I will present results of our on-going work including examples of "exotic" structures combining the Three Graces.

    Our research was facilitated by advances in computer-assisted mathematics, and in particular the computer algebra system Maple worksheets written by the first author expressly for this project extended hand calculations of the second author dating from some 20 years ago.

A novelty of our exposition is that we define an enriched category to be a category with extra structure, rather than as an independent structure from which an underlying category is derived. We draw on higher category theory for examples and counterexamples

    I have previously spoken about how a mild generalization of the Batanin-Markl notion of operadic category is equivalent to a certain type of skew monoidal structure on a power of Set, and that the actual notion of Batanin-Markl corresponds to the case where the skew monoidal category is left normal (the left unit maps are invertible). I have also previously spoken about how, under mild conditions, one can replace a skew monoidal category by one which has the same category of monoids, but is right normal. If the original skew monoidal category arises from a (generalized) operadic category, the "right normalization" may not.

    In this talk, I describe how, under mild conditions, one can replace a skew monoidal category by one which is left normal. This time the category of monoids is not the same (although the category of comonoids is). But this time the original skew monoidal category corresponds to an operadic category, then so does the "left normalization". This allows one to replace a generalized operadic category by a genuine (that is, a Batanin-Markl) one.

    I also give some examples related to the Borisov-Manin category of graphs.

If the underlying object of [(A,t),(A,t)] is itself the internal hom [A,A] in K, then we may think of this opmonoidal monad as a bialgebroid.

  abstract: Of one the more interesting endofunctors of the category of categories is the one which associates to a category C its category of endomorphisms End(C). If C is a stable infinity category then End(C) is as well, and the associated K-theory spectrum KEnd(C):=K(End(C)) is called the K-theory of endomorphisms of C. Using calculations of Almkvist together with the theory of noncommutative motives of Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada, we classify equivalence classes of endomorphisms of the KEnd functor in terms of a noncompeleted version of the Witt vectors of the polynomial ring Z[t], answering a question posed by Almkvist in the 70s. As applications, we obtain various lifts of Witt rings to the sphere spectrum as well as a more structured version of the cyclotomic trace via cyclic K-theory, as studied in recent work of Kaledin and Nikolaus-Scholze.

    We study the category of algebras of a polynomial monad equipped with a (semi)model structure lifted from the model category of W-locally constant functors on its underlying category. Here W is a proper Grothendieck fundamental localiser and operads and algebras have values in a combinatorial monoidal model category.

    We investigate when this localisation has some good properties. In particular, we are interested when the forgetful functor from the category of algebras reflects local weak equivalences. We single out a class of such polynomial monads which we call locally left derivable and show that the monads for n-operads, symmetric and braided operads are in this class.

    As an application we develop a homotopy theory of higher braided operads and prove some stabilization theorems for them from which we obtain yet another proof of generalised Baez-Dolan stabilization hypothesis.

Like the model structure for 2-categories, this induced model structure is monoidal with respect to the Gray tensor product, but unlike the model structure for 2-categories, the induced model structure is moreover cartesian

In classical case (presheaf of small categories) these two constructions are isomorphic but in general they are quite different. I will prove then a version of Thomason's theorem  on homotopy colimits related to the second construction (there is also a version of Thomason's theorem related to the first construction which I mentioned in one of my previous talks).

  abstract: In my seminar talk of 7 March this year, I gave various viewpoints on Jacobs' notion of "hypernormalisation" for probability distributions. In this talk, I explain that, really, the correct setting for hypernormalisation is a symmetric monoidal category endowed with a linear exponential monad (in the sense of linear logic). I use this to give various examples of hypernormalisation going beyond Jacobs' original setting. I conjecture that the finitely additive probability distribution monad on the category of sets is terminal among linear exponential monads with respect to the "convex" monoidal structure on Set.

  abstract: Classical questions about the representations of Lie algebra in positive characteristic are answered by Lusztig's conjectures, which have now been established by Bezrukavnikov-Mirkovic using geometric techniques. Lusztig's conjectures are phrased in terms of canonical bases, and we give a categorical approach to the proof in type A, which is more elementary in nature. In the case where the central character is a nilpotent whose Jordan type is a two-row partition, we give explicit combinatorial formulae for the dimensions of the irreducible modules. The categorical action of an affine braid group plays a key role here.

  abstract: In his book on presheaves as models for homotopy types, Cisinski leaves as an exercise to the reader to show that a (presheaf) topos equipped with a Cisinski model structure (i.e. a combinatorial model structure in which the cofibrations are the monomorphisms), determined by an exact cylinder and a class of anodyne extensions, admits a canonical enrichment over the monoidal model category of cubical sets. In this talk, we will carry out this exercise and use these cubical enrichments to explain some of the basic features of the theory of Cisinski model structures, such as the notion of exact cylinder, the construction of classes of anodyne extensions, and the relationship between localisers and Bousfield localisations.

These triangles compose to yield the category Lens, and we demonstrate both Diskin's d-lenses and split opfibrations as special cases.

    If E is a category with finite limits, then categories, functors and natural transformations can be made sense of internally to E. The assignment of a finite limit category to the resulting 2-category Cat(E) extends to a 2-functor from finite limit categories to finite weighted limit 2-categories. This 2-functor has a left biadjoint given by the 'underlying finite limit category', and the resulting biadjunction is pseudocomonadic. We will also see a distributive law of this pseudocomonad over itself given by transposition of double categories, and two other monad like structures on the same 2-functor.

    This talk will be based on my recently completed masters thesis.

  abstract: I'll begin with Bost's generalization of the p-curvature conjecture, and describe the classical geometric concepts at play such as the horizontal subbundle corresponding to a connection and parallel transport. This naturally motivates the discovery of the Gauss-Manin connection on algebraic de Rham cohomology, and its non-abelian analogue due to Simpson. I'll state Katz's theorem that the p-curvature conjecture (equivalently Bost) holds for the abelian Gauss-Manin connection, and the ingredients to even make that statement, such as the Hodge filtration, conjugate filtration, and Kodaira-Spencer map. I'll then define non-abelian analogues of these objects, and state a theorem which suitably equates them. This is the non-abelian analogue of part 1 of Katz's theorem, and is progress towards proving Bost for the non-abelian Gauss-Manin connection.

    A useful and intuitively nice approach to thinking about operad-like structures is in terms of families of graphs that encode their combinatorics. (Martin Markl coined the umbrella term '(operadic) pasting scheme' to systemise this approach.) The idea is very simple, but the details can get quite messy. Joyal and Kock [JK] used a clever definition of graphs to construct a big class of operad-like structures that they called compact symmetric multicategories. Everything in their construction was functorial, and required a minimum of data - but it wasn't quite correct. In this talk, I'll give some context to the story and explain the J-K construction and where it goes wrong. I'll talk about a solution in a following seminar.

  abstract: |-
    The purpose of the talk is to lay (some of) the groundwork for observations Richard Garner and I have been stumbling into during my visit.

    In particular, we observed that there is a Galois adjunction between join restriction categories (and functors) over a manifold complete category, B, and internal partite categories (and cofunctors) within B.  The adjunction specializes to an isomorphism between join restriction categories hyperconnected over B and source etale partite categories within B.
    The observation seems to unify a number of similar observations in the literature ranging from semigroup theory to differential topology.

    The story behind these ideas started about 30 years ago when Marco Grandis (using rather different nomenclature) introduced the manifold construction and manifold complete categories.  The first talk will be aimed at developing some of this "abstract topology" for join restriction categories in so far as it is required to support the main observations above.

    The inner automorphisms of a group G are those given by conjugation by an element a of G. George Bergman has characterised them abstractly as the automorphisms of G which admit a functorial extension along any group homomorphism G → H to an automorphism of H.

    This notion of extended inner automorphism makes sense for objects of any category C. The purpose of this talk is to characterise the inner automorphisms of groupoids. We show that they are exactly the automorphisms given by conjugation by bisections. The twist is that this has to be done not in the category of groupoids and functors, but in the category of groupoids and cofunctors.

  abstract: |-
    A restriction category is an abstraction of sets and partial functions. In a restriction category, each map is associated to an idempotent on its domain object; these idempotents are called restriction idempotents, which we may think of as partial identity maps expressing domains of definition. In 2016, Garner and Lin proposed a notion of cocomplete restriction category; i.e., a restriction category whose restriction idempotents split, whose subcategory of total maps is cocomplete (in the ordinary sense), and whose colimits in this subcategory are preserved by its inclusion.

    However, just as (ordinary) cocomplete categories may be characterised as having all (ordinary) colimits, it would be nice to have an analogous characterisation of cocomplete restriction categories. Indeed, this is what we will discuss in this talk. We will present a notion of restriction colimit, and give an application of this within the context of gluings and atlases.

    Joint work with Emily Riehl

    I've always been very fond of Dubuc's Adjoint Triangle theorems. It seems to me that they are an important, surprisingly useful, and yet oft overlooked tool in the category theory armoury. Indeed, as a canonical example of sheer elegance and beauty in categorical proof making, one can really do no better than Paré's adjoint lifting proof that elementary toposes are finitely cocomplete.

    So how might we import these techniques into the world of synthetic ∞-category theory? More specifically, how can we prove such results in the framework provided by ∞-Cosmoi and homotopy coherent monads that Emily Riehl and I have been developing over the past few years? While left adjoint lifting is straightforward by (relatively) elementary means in this context, right adjoint lifting has proved a little more elusive.

    Classically, right adjoint lifting entails the construction of a transformation of the monads generated by the adjunctions we are lifting along and, until recently, a natural generalisation of that construction to the ∞-cosmos setting had eluded us. That isn't to say that we didn't have a perfectly workable theory of such transformations to work with, as furnished by Dimitri Zaganidis' elegant diagrammatic description of the $(\infty,2)$-category of homotopy coherent monads. Instead the stumbling block has been entirely one of my own inability to competently drive that beautiful machine.

    In this talk  we shall discuss a novel way to describe the ∞-double category of lax squares in an ∞-Cosmos and use that to explicate the structure of the $(\infty,2)$-category of homotopy coherent monads and their transformations. In that way we shall largely sidestep Zaganidis' beautiful combinatorics (although it will still arise in applications) and avoid introducing any exotic $(\infty,2)$-structures, beyond those available to us in the (strictly) quasi-category enriched world of ∞-Cosmoi. This allows us to give an entirely elementary account of Dubuc's right adjoint lifting result for ∞-categories living in arbitrary ∞-Cosmoi which I shall conclude this talk with.

  abstract: Picking up where we left off at my previous talk, we introduce an enriched notion of definable category. Then, if our base for enrichment is a symmetric monoidal finitary variety, we can prove a duality between the 2-category V-Ex of small exact V-categories, and V-Def of definable V-categories, generalizing the ordinary result of Kuber-Rosicky, and the additive version of Prest-Rajani. We then use this to give an explicit description of the free exact completions over finitely complete V-categories and over regular V-categories.

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: A lot of ideas from category theory find their practical application in programming languages. The optics library is probably the most extreme example. We have lenses and prisms, which categorize the idea of decomposing and recomposing products and coproducts, giving interpretation to doubles of monoidal categories. Then we have their implementation in terms of profunctors, which relate, through Yoneda embedding, to Tambara modules. But optics go beyond Tambara modules and monoidal structures. There are grates based on closed structures, and traversals that have so far eluded categorical derivation.

Briefly, the problem is to describe the group of symmetries of an orbifold arising as the quotient $\R^N/G$, where $G$ is a group of affine transformations.

  abstract: This talk still runs with the idea that polynomials can be considered as certain spans of spans. Polynomials are now defined in bicategories equipped with a calibration, which is a class of morphisms called neat. The bicategory is polynomic as in the last talk when the groupoid fibrations are the neat morphisms for a calibration. Tabulations are used to produce examples of calibrations. This is a fairly major revision of the topic (although the calibration and tabulation ideas were in a dismissed version from January 2019) and allows for examples other than bicategories of spans.

In particular one can explicitly construct unitary representations or actions on various operator algebras.

    This is the third talk of a series. In two previous talks I showed how to construct a E_{n+1}-algebra structure on a total complex of an n-commutative cosimplicial monoid.
    In this talk I'll explain that this action can be made combinatorially explicit. More specifically I'll prove a formula for Poisson bracket of degree - n in terms of a sum over all noncommutative liftings of smooth Delannoy paths on a pxq -lattice. Except for application to deformation theory of tensor categories this result can be very useful for constructing of explicit small models of E_{n+1}-algebras. I conjecture that there should be a Quillen equivalence between n-commutative cosimplicial R-algebras and E_{n+1}-algebras over a commutative ring R.

While reviewing Marco Grandis' 2012 book on Homological Algebra for Zentralblatt, I wondered about the existence of a nice proof of associativity of relations in a Puppe-exact category. I am trying to obtain any published proof at all; Marco attributes it to a 1967 paper of Tsalenko. In any case, I seem to have a decent proof in the vein of the first sentence of this abstract.

    The talk proposes a new method to complete a triangulated category, which is based on the notion of a Cauchy sequence.

    We apply this to categories of perfect complexes. For example, the bounded derived category of finitely presented modules
    over a right coherent ring is the completion of the category of perfect complexes.

  speaker: Edouard Balzin
  date: 2019-08-14T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    It has been known since Segal that various small categories can be used as blueprints for algebraic structures in homotopy theory, providing alternatives to operads in such questions as for example delooping. The examples of those categories include finite sets, ordered sets, n-ordinals of Batanin and various exit path categories of configuration spaces, as well as categories of operators of general topological operads. More recently, the Lurie has shown how to develop higher-categorical algebra using the language of various fibrations over such categories, provided one is willing to pay the price of (immense) technical difficulty.

    In our talk, we would like to explain the examples of various operation-indexing categories (and offer a definition of such a notion due to Harpaz) and how one can use them to describe homotopy-algebraic structures via the fibrations of model and higher categories. Our approach is arguably much less technical than that of Lurie, and provides what can be viewed as “Segal objects” in chain complexes of vector spaces. Depending on time and the interest of the audience, we may also present the particular example of the category of trees of Kontsevich-Soibelman and discuss its relation to the Hochschild cohomology.

  abstract: Lenses were originally introduced as a mathematical structure which captures the notion of synchronisation between a pair of sets. When extending this idea to consider synchronisation between a pair of categories, we obtain functors akin to split Grothendieck opfibrations lacking the universal property. Internal lenses have previously been introduced to describe synchronisation between internal categories. The purpose of this talk is to motivate the definition of a symmetric lens between internal categories as a pair of internal Mealy morphisms (or two-dimensional partial maps) and establish the relationship with spans of internal lenses, generalising previous work of Johnson and Rosebrugh.

  title: On lax limits of families of model categories
  speaker: Edouard Balzin
  date: 2019-08-21T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    This is both a continuation of my previous talk and an independent exposition on the subject of studying lax limits (also known as sections) of the families of categories (understood as fibrations in a flexible sense) with homotopical structure, such as model categories. The first large class of examples of such families are Quillen presheaves: those are diagrams of model categories and Quillen adjunctions. These families often appear in geometry. For Quillen presheaves one can prove that taking lax limits commutes with forming the infinity (Dwyer-Kan) localisation; we may explain what a proof of this statement looks like.

    Another example of model categorical families appears in the context of algebra, and is not given by Quillen presheaves. Studying lax limits of such families can be still done model-categorically by introducing the notion of a Segal section. As a consequence one can study model-categorically various objects appearing in higher algebra, e.g. E_2 algebras over a field of positive characteristic, with statements such as the existence of homotopy colimits of these objects proven rather easily (I will be curious to know why).

  abstract: |-
    In this talk, we will prove that a morphism of (weak) complicial sets is a marked homotopy equivalence iff (i) it is essentially surjective on (globular) n-cells for all n, and (ii) it reflects thinness of n-cells for all n; if the complicial sets are saturated, then property (i) suffices. It follows that a morphism of n-complicial sets is a marked homotopy equivalence iff it is essentially surjective on objects and a marked homotopy equivalence on (n-1)-complicial hom-sets.

    The most difficult step in the proof is to show that every marked simplicial set can be expressed as an iterated homotopy colimit (in Verity's model structure for complicial sets) of the free-living n-cells. We will do so with the help of a combinatorial algorithm of Verity, which transmutes any n-simplex in a complicial set into one whose initial face is degenerate on a vertex.

    At least since Baez-Dolan '95, we've understood that any correct definition for the notion of symmetric monoidal n-category is equivalent to the one which defines symmetric monoidal n-categories as infinite loop categories. We will synthesize this position with a purely combinatorial treatment of spectra found in Kan '63.
    More explicitly, we will extend the proof that the theta categories of Joyal, together with the sets of (higher) spine inclusions provide essentially algebraic presentations of strict categories to provide a definition of the abiding notion of strict Z-categories. We'll then describe a natural subcategory of the category of pointed presheaves on this essentially algebraic theory for Z-categories we'll call the locally finite subcategory and we'll then use Kan's observation to put a model structure on this subcategory which:
    -) corresponds intuitively to a Z-graded groupoidal composition law; and

What DoPeGDO means: the category of Docile Perturbed Gaussian Differential Operators. And what sl(2+,ϵ) means: a solvable approximation of the semi-simple Lie algebra sl(2).

    from a finitary monad to the corresponding Lawvere theory is exhibited as a free completion of an enriched category under a class of absolute colimits. The extension from
    base Set to an arbitrary locally finitely presentable category requires enrichment over a bicategory, rather than a monoidal category. The talk will focus on the definitions and
    constructions rather than upon the proof.

  speaker: Richard Garner
  date: 2019-11-20T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    A result due to Bourke, subsequently developed further by Miranda, states that the 2-category of finitely complete 2-categories is pseudocomonadic over the 2-category of finitely complete ordinary categories, via the pseudocomonad E |→ Cat(E).

    We explain a more general version of this result: if V is locally finitely presentable as a symmetric monoidal category, then the 2-category of finitely complete V-categories is comonadic over the 2-category of finitely complete ordinary categories. Besides the motivating case V = Cat, this applies, for example, when V = Ch or V = sSet.

    We also mention a result in a similar spirit, due to Rosolini, Emennegger and Pasquali, stating that the 2-category of finite product fibrations with equality is comonadic over the 2-category of finite product fibrations, and speculate as to how it might fit into the same pattern.

  speaker: Martina Rovelli
  date: 2019-11-27T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: It is desirable that a good candidate model for the homotopy theory of (∞,n)-categories should interact nicely with the existent homotopy theory of strict n-categories. When n = 0,1, it is understood that the homotopy theory of sets and of strict 1-categories embeds in that of ∞-categories and ∞-groupoids, essentially for all existing models. When n = 2 and we consider saturated 2-complicial sets as a model of (∞, 2)-categories, the picture is more complicated. In this talk we will describe a homotopically fully faithful nerve construction that embeds the homotopy theory of 2-categories in that of (∞, 2)-categories in the form of saturated 2-complicial sets. More precisely, this nerve construction is a right Quillen functor that creates the model structure for 2-categories. This is joint work with V. Ozornova.

    1. Feynman categories Fey form a full reflective subcategory of operadic categories Oper.

    2. There are two other functors: O: Fey → Oper, F:Oper → Fey with the property that the composites F(O) and O(F) are +-constructions on corresponding categories.

    3. Both Fey and Oper are equipped with comprehensive factorisation systems which are consistent with the above functors in appropriate sense.

    A codifferential category is a symmetric monoidal k-linear category endowed with a special kind of monad which allows it to interpret differential calculus. Part of this structure is that of an "algebra modality"—this means that it is a monad with a map from the free commutative monoid monad. We explain how the notion of codifferential category arises automatically from two more basic ingredients: the 2-category of algebra modalities and lax morphisms; and the process of adjoining a nilsquare object to a symmetric monoidal
    category.

  abstract: |-
    In this third talk in the series, we'll begin by pulling at a loose end from the previous talk; we'll explore the interpretation of fibrant objects for an accessible Cisinski localizer as weak/homotopy models for a sketch.

    We'll see how  Cisinski's Lambda^{∞} construction informs us that fibrant objects are homotopy coherent models in the sense that:

    -) they interpret all partial operations in the regulus;
    -) any functional relation is homotopy/substitution invariant; and
    -) witnesses to these facts are essentially unique/coherent.

    What's more, Ara has proved that in many cases of interest, this notion of homotopy coherent models coincides with the natural generalization of (complete) Segal spaces to an arbitrary sketch.

    We'll then describe the theory of strict Z-categories and strict Z_≤-categories, and lay out how weak versions, defined by way of the earlier discussion, fit into a grander scheme synthesizing Grothendieck's homotopy hypothesis and the Baez-Dolan stabilization hypothesis.

  abstract: This talk is on a different subject, and is independent of the talk a couple of weeks ago, but the commonality of "one good leg" calculations will illuminate both.  This week we'll do more technical details as we confront approaches to applications that involve more than two systems maintaining synchronisation.  This is done via so-called "multilenses".  Multilenses were defined by Diskin, and sometimes could be combined (arguablly composed) to form bigger multilenses, but there was no discernable category structure.  We'll see how a restriction of multilenses to those with "one good leg" leads to a tractable well-defined composition and a multicategory of multilenses.

    I have defined polynomial in a calibrated bicategory M; it is a span with one very good leg and the other fairly good. (In reference to Michael Johnson's ACS talk on 12 Feb and the work of Bryce Clarke, fairly good can be no restriction.)

    The calibration allows polynomials to compose as spans. Tabulations from the terminal object in a bicategory M give rise to a calibration. The guiding example of this phenomenon was the bicategory of spans in a finitely complete category. I shall give two other examples and reinterpret the bicategories of polynomials in terms of Kleisli bicategories.

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    As category theorists, our ideas of homotopy theory and higher structures are framed in the language of infinity-categories and model category theory. These immensely powerful tools have provided us profound insights into our subject and the systems it can model. However, there are many mathematicians working with higher structures who are untrained in categorical methods (and even some who actively go out of their way to avoid them). And, even for us, it can be valuable to come down to earth and consider what's happening at a more nuts-and-bolts level.

    This talk is about some characteristics to help identify infinity operads when we encounter them in the wild. More precisely, I'll give a number of necessary and sufficient conditions on a graded space (simplicial set) for it to underly a (monochrome, planar) dendroidal Segal space. Depending on time, recipes, in the form of direct (independent of model theoretic techniques) proofs of these equivalences will be discussed, and we may look at a nice example that illustrates some of these features.

  location: Online
  abstract: |-
    In 1990, Tony Hoare and He Jifeng wrote a paper called "Data refinement in a categorical setting." Sir Tony is a particularly influential computer engineer, and data refinement is a critical, practical aspect of computer science. They proposed specific category theoretic constructs as a body of theory in support of data refinement, unaware of a relevant, unifying category theoretic body of work but stating explicitly that surely such a body of category theory exists. In fact, without realising it, they proposed specific instances of finitary V-monads on V, equivalently Lawvere V-theories, where V is the category of small locally ordered categories with the Gray tensor product.

    At the time, Max Kelly had studied the situation for symmetric V, and the extant theory for bicategories did not include their examples. So Bob Gordon and I extended Max's work and more in order to provide the theory. In this talk, I plan simply to explain informally what happened as best I recall it, thus providing a solid computer science motivation for the study of categories enriched in non-symmetric monoidal biclosed categories.

    It is known that, in the accessible context, limit sketches correspond to limit/colimits sketches (this is due to Lair and Makkai-Pare'), but what happens to the orthogonality and reflectivity conditions? We'll see that they can be replaced by the two notions of "virtual orthogonality" and "virtual reflectivity"  which we'll be introduced during the talk.

  title: Adequacy for algebraic effects
  speaker: John Power
  date: 2020-04-15T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Online
  abstract: |-
    Algebraic effects were first identified by Plotto and me in a paper in FOSSACS in 2001, where we proposed a unified treatment of operational semantics for such effects. There had long been operational semantics for each of the effects: the aim was to give a unified account that recognisably related to the extant ones.

    One notices immediately that one must have algebraic operations, e.g., read, write, nondeterministic "or", lookup and update, in order even to write down programs with effects, and that no monad appears in any program. A few weeks after the paper was published, we realised that, if one adds computationally natural equations to the operations, the monads, which arose in types and in models rather than in programs, are redundant: continuations are not an algebraic effect. This perspective suddenly made clear how to deal with previously intractable aspects of effects. That has sparked  immense development that continues to this day.

    For this talk, I propose to give historical context of the paper, thus outlines of PCF and structural operational semantics, then an outline of what we did and what followed. I do not plan to say much at all about recursion: the point of that part of the paper was that what we did extends to recursion, which of course is vital, and recognisably relates to extant operational semantics there. I hope to give a brief idea of how this led to our work on tensors in regard to state, cf Richard's talk last week.

  abstract: |-
    At the seminar a fortnight ago, Sophie asked a question that is much more profound than she probably realised: "What is 'lookup'? I did not answer at the time as it would have been too great a digression, but I promised another talk about it, and this is it.

    We have been told for over 30 years that one may model state by use of the "state" or "side-effects" monad, (Sx-)^S for a countable set S, but the situation is more subtle than that, and category theory can help to illuminate some of the structure.

    There are natural operations and equations that generate the monad (Sx-)^S, which I shall describe. The operations may be described as lookup:X^S→X and update:X→X^S. However, lookup is of countable arity, whereas programming languages do not have operations of countable arity in general. That concern led Plotto to define a notion of "generic effect", that being equivalent to giving an operation. The underlying category theory of the correspondence is routine, but the computational significance is profound. It amounts to adding a new type to the language to represent an arity, then adding a constant of that type to represent an operation of the corresponding arity. The correspondence makes lookup and update into familiar programming constructs.

    Beyond that, in practice, a state is typically a function from a finite set Loc of locations into a countable set Val of values, with lookup meaning looking up a location, and update meaning updating a value. The state monad is predicated upon that, with (Sx-)^S referring to "global" state. However, typically, a program may also add locations using, for example, a block operation. So we studied  lookup, update and block, yielding a more subtle monad on a presheaf category, modelling the computationally more natural "local" state. There is an oversight in the paper (my mistake), and more importantly, I do not believe there has been a definitive semantic account of local state yet, but we made substantial progress, which I shall describe.

    A few weeks ago, I explained how models and comodels of an algebraic theory T can encode programs and their associated environments. This week I will explain how co-S-models in the category of T-models provide a way of translating T-environments into S-environments.

    In particular, I consider the case where S and T are the free theories generated by an A-ary, respectively B-ary operation. In this case, co-S-models in T-models encode a simple kind of automaton translating streams of B's into streams of A's. Our novel result is that the terminal co-S-model in T-models (describing possible behaviours of such automata) is exactly the set of continuous functions between Baire spaces B^N→A^N; this realises the old idea of Brouwer that continuous = computable, and extends prior work of Hancock, Ghani and Pattinson.

  title: I want to be straight!
  speaker: Dominic Verity
  date: 2020-05-13T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Online
  abstract: |-
    One of the key constructions in Jacob Lurie's development of quasi-category theory is the (un)straightening equivalence which, for our purposes here, we might decompose into two stages. The first of these is, in essence, the Grothendieck construction, which straightens functors f: A^{op} → Q , with codomain the quasi-category of small  infinity-categories Q, into cartesian (nee Grothendieck) fibrations  p:E → A  with small fibres. The second relates a functor quasi-category  [A^{op},Q]  to the homotopy coherent nerve of a corresponding enriched model category  [CA^{op}, sSet_J]  of simplicial presheaves under the Joyal model structure. This step straightens homotopy coherent natural transformations into (strict) simplicially natural ones. In this talk we propose to implement the second of these steps in the complicial model of  (∞,∞)-categories and thereby provide a foundation for developing the category theory of those structures.

    Specifically, let  msSet_C  denote the model category of marked (nee stratified) simplicial sets equipped with a complicial model structure and let M denote a model category enriched in there. Assume further that M is well behaved enough to ensure that for each (small)  msSet -enriched category D the enriched functor category [D,M]  admits the projective model structure, thereby making it into a  msSet_C -enriched model category (M is an admissible model category say). Then given any (small) marked simplicial set  X \in msSet  we shall construct a straightening equivalence

    N([CX,M]_{cf}) → [X, N(M_{cf})]
    of complicial sets, wherein N denotes the homotopy coherent nerve construction for complicially enriched categories and C denotes its left adjoint, homotopy coherent realisation.

  location: Online
  abstract: |-
    After my most recent seminar, a few of the participants, notably Sophie, Steve and Mike, expressed interest in local state. I wrote two papers about local state after the paper I presented last time. So I thought it might be helpful for me to speak about the last one, despite its being ten years old and not being definitive.

    The goal was to understand the algebras for the monad on [Inj,Set] for local state as the models of a kind of Lawvere theory. I could not achieve that, but I made some progress.  I introduced the notion of a D-indexed Lawvere theory and its models, with the leading example having D=Inj, thus not having finite products. So the definition is not as one would expect from the perspective of fibrations. Moreover, with the specific goal firmly in mind, I took models in an ordinary category with finite products rather than in a D-indexed category with finite products, thus another strange definition.

    That, together with the use of a tensor of theories, allowed me to model lookup and state, but for block, one needs a way of moving from a state with n locations to a state with n+1 locations. Exponentiation with the final comodel of a Lawvere theory allowed me to do that, thus modelling block, but I could not see how to model some block axioms, so I ended with the most elegant hack I could see.

  title: The folk model structure for double categories
  speaker: Alexander Campbell
  date: 2020-06-17T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Online
  abstract: |-
    In this talk, I will introduce a new model structure on the category of double categories and double functors, which I will argue is the most natural analogue for double categories of Lack's model structure for 2-categories. This "folk" model structure is completely characterised by the following two of its properties: every double category is fibrant, and a double functor is a trivial fibration iff it is surjective on objects, full on horizontal morphisms, full on vertical morphisms, and fully faithful on squares. Note that this model structure is preserved by all eight auto-equivalences of the category of double categories.

    This model structure shares many of the excellent features of Lack's model structure for 2-categories. For instance, it is proper, it is monoidal with respect to Bohm's Gray tensor product for double categories, a double category is cofibrant iff its underlying categories of horizontal and vertical morphisms are free, and the double pseudofunctor classifier comonad is a cofibrant replacement comonad. Moreover, Lack's model structure for 2-categories is created by the (homotopically fully faithful) "double category of squares" functor from the folk model structure for double categories.

    I will also introduce the notion of double quasi-category, defined as the fibrant objects of a Cisinski model structure on the category of bisimplicial sets, which I will argue presents the correct ∞-categorical generalisation of the notion of double category. I will prove that the folk model structure for double categories is right-induced by Watson's bisimplicial nerve functor from the model structure for double quasi-categories, and that this nerve functor is homotopically fully faithful.

  title: A distributive law for modular operads
  speaker: Sophie Raynor
  date: 2020-07-01T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Online
  abstract: |-
    The combinatorics of modular operads are governed by undirected graphs of arbitrary genus, and are therefore significantly more complex than those of ordinary operads. I'll discuss a very general notion of modular operad - essentially the compact symmetric multicategories of Joyal and Kock - for which the combination of the contraction operation with a unital operadic composition presents particular challenges for constructing a suitable nerve.

    In this talk, I'll break down the issues and sketch a construction of a composite monad for modular operads. The decomposition enables us to apply Weber's nerve machinery to obtain a fully faithful nerve. Perhaps more importantly, the combinatorics of modular operads - and especially the tricky bits - are made fully explicit. This provides a roadmap for generalising results to this setting, and for further generalising the setting itself, and I'll indicate some of these new directions.

  title: Straightening a la Joyal
  speaker: Alexander Campbell
  date: 2020-07-29T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Online
  abstract: |-
    The development of ∞-category theory in Lurie's book 'Higher Topos Theory' is founded on a series of rectification theorems, the first of which is the (unmarked) Straightening Theorem. This theorem states that, for each simplicial set A, the straightening–unstraightening adjunction is a Quillen equivalence between the category of simplicial presheaves over the homotopy coherent realisation of A (equipped with the projective Kan model structure) and the category of simplicial sets over A (equipped with the contravariant model structure, whose fibrant objects are the right fibrations over A). Lurie's proof of this theorem is notoriously difficult; alternative proofs – substantially different from Lurie's proof and from each other – have since been given by Stevenson and by Heuts and Moerdijk.

    In this talk, I will present a new, simple proof of the Straightening Theorem. This proof is based on an idea which may be found in Section 51 of Joyal's 'Notes on quasi-categories': we factorise the straightening–unstraightening adjunction as the composite of three adjunctions (in fact, two adjunctions and one equivalence), each of which we show to be a Quillen equivalence. One of these adjunctions (the equivalence) is easily seen to be a Quillen equivalence (in fact, an equivalence of model categories). To prove that the remaining two adjunctions are Quillen equivalences, I will use my recent proof of Joyal's Cylinder Conjecture.

Both of these model structures share the distinctive feature of admitting a homotopically fully faithful functor from Lack's model structure on 2-categories to them – this can be rephrased in vaguer terms as saying that they contain the homotopy theory of 2-categories. Moreover, both induce Lack's model structure through (some version of) the horizontal embedding $H:\text{2Cat} \to \text{DblCat}$. We will introduce these model structures together with their main properties, and discuss their similitudes and differences.

The aim of this talk is to recover these (and provide new) examples as part of a general setting.

    In this series of talks (borrowing from a talk jointly written with Nuiok Dicaire) we'll:
    *) Explore how type theories for certain cartesian monoidal (hihger)-categories, HoTT for example, through their term calculus can:

    'give structuralists their elements back'

    in the sense that we are granted a form of reasoning:
    **) which looks and feels like reasoning about sets with elements; but
    **) which comes with syntactic limits on that which can be defined:
    -) functions,
    -) propositions,
    -) etc.
    such that this elementary reasoning coincides precisely with reasoning about the structural, i.e. (higher)-categorical properties of objects.

    *) Develop Mike Shulman's:

    "... Practical Type Theory for Symmetric Monoidal Categories"

    as a type theory with a term calculus which extends this program to symmetric monoidal categories

    *) Treat the example of the free dual pair in this type theory in some detail, explaining:
    **) how a natural presentation of the free dual pair as a co-equalizer of free (coloured)-Props defines a PTT
    **) how the term calulus of the type theory recovers the familiar elementary relationship between functions and functional from the structural one of a duality
    **) see how the cyclicity of trace is easily proved elementarily in this type theory

    *) Describe how the computads of Street, Batanin, et al. and the strictification results of Schommer-Pries pave the way towards higher dimensional variants of Shulman's PTT and a synthetic treatment of symmetric monoidal bicategories, etc.

    (this last topic will cover joint work with Nuiok Dicaiure, Zeinab Galal, Paige North, Mike Shulman, and Sam Speight)

    I've mentioned informally the connection between modular operads and compact closed categories a few times, so
    it's about time I made it precise.

    This is the first of two talks on the subject. This week, I'll review the definition of modular operads and introduce a category of circuit operads. These are modular operads with some extra structure and are closely related to Bar-Natan and Dansco's circuit algebras used in low dimensional topology.

    Then I'll describe an monadic adjunction between modular operads and the category of small compact closed categories, and modify it to obtain an idempotent adjunction between circuit operads and small compact closed categories. Next time, I'll use an iterated distributive law to prove a nerve theorem for circuit operads.

We will then consider its restrictions to three distinguished subcategories of sSet which will be of interest:

    3 qCat; quasi-categories.

    In each of these cases, I will provide a more familiar description of the coalgebra structures. I will also describe some examples of decalages and Dec-coalgebras along the way.

  abstract: The category of elements construction, which describes an equivalence between functors into Set and discrete opfibrations, may be generalised in several ways. One such generalisation is the equivalence between lax double functors into Span, from a small category B, and ordinary functors into B. In the paper "Lax Presheaves and Exponentiability", Niefield studies the cases when spans are replaced with relations (jointly-monic spans) or partial functions (spans with monic left leg). The purpose of this talk is to examine the case when spans are replaced with multi-valued functions (spans with epic left leg). The main result will prove an equivalence between lax double functors from a small category B into sMult (the double category of "split" multi-valued functions) and delta lenses into B.

  abstract: |-
    In a 1990 paper, Peter Johnstone gave various characterisations of the class of algebraic theories whose category of models in Set is cartesian closed. One of these was syntactic, and a little involved; another was semantic, characterising them as those obtained as the so-called "two-valued collapse" of a Grothendieck topos with a set of projective generators.

    The objective of these talks (for there will be more than one) is to improve on Johnstone's characterisation results: in the end, we will prove to the semantic side that the category of cartesian closed algebraic theories is equivalent to the category of strongly zero-dimensional source-etale localic categories, and cofunctors between them.

    However, the focus this time will be on the syntactic side: we show that Johnstone's slightly involved conditions can be simplified, proving in the end that cartesian closed theories are precisely which decompose as a kind of semidirect product of a unary theory and a hyperaffine one.

Our construction is a generalisation to the ∞-categorical setting of a construction of the Gray monoidal structure for 2-categories due to Ross Street, which uses the techniques from Brian Day's PhD thesis for extending a monoidal structure along a dense functor. The proof of our construction uses, among other things, the results from Yuki's recent PhD thesis on the Gray tensor product for 2-quasi-categories. I will also mention a few of the open problems concerning the Gray monoidal structure for (∞,2)-categories, and explain how our results can be used to simplify (though not yet solve) one of these problems.

  abstract: |-
    In [2], my PhD supervisors (Pieter Hofstra and Philip Scott) and I studied the new topos-theoretic phenomenon of isotropy (as introduced in [1]) in the context of single-sorted algebraic theories, and we gave a logical/syntactic characterization of the isotropy group of any such theory, thereby showing that it encodes a notion of inner automorphism for the theory. In the present talk, I will summarize the results of my recent PhD thesis, in which I build on this earlier work by studying the isotropy groups of (multi-sorted) quasi-equational theories (also known as essentially algebraic, cartesian, or finite limit theories). In particular, I will show how to give a logical/syntactic characterization of the isotropy group of any such theory, and how it encodes a notion of inner automorphism for the theory. I will also describe how I have used this characterization to exactly characterize the 'inner automorphisms' for several different examples of quasi-equational theories, most notably the theory of strict monoidal categories and the theory of presheaves valued in a category of models. In particular, the latter example provides a characterization of the (covariant) isotropy group of a category of set-valued presheaves, which had been an open question.

  location: Online
  abstract: It is well-known that small categories are generalisations of monoids, but what is a most suitable way of generalising monoid homomorphisms? While functors between categories provide a familiar solution, Aguiar showed that there is also a fully faithful functor from the category of monoids and monoid homomorphisms to the category of small categories and cofunctors. Furthermore, this fully faithful functor has an interesting right adjoint, which assigns each category to its monoid of ``admissible sections''. In this talk, I will discuss the (2-)category of categories and cofunctors, and provide several characterisations of this right adjoint. I will then explore how this adjunction extends to other contexts, including (Schreier) split epimorphisms between monoids, delta lenses, and split opfibrations.

  abstract: |-
    The model independence of (∞,1)-category theory has never been in doubt, but it was unclear whether the model-independence of (∞,1)-category could be proven systematically, or whether "experts" would have to be relied on to provide ad hoc translations between models. Compounding this issue is the inevitable subtlety in understanding which statements about (∞,1)-categories are model-independent. For instance, the completeness axiom for Segal spaces has no clear analogue in the other models.

    In past work, we have shown that a large part of the theory of (∞,1)-categories can be developed formally in the virtual equipment of modules, and moreover that the virtual equipments associated to the common models of (∞,1)-categories are all "biequivalent" in a suitable sense. In this talk we adapt Makkai's First Order Logic with Dependent Sorts to define a formal language for writing statements about (∞,1)-categories, and prove that the validity of every formula written in that language is invariant under change of model.

    This is joint work with Dominic Verity.

  abstract: |-
    The new theory of "condensed mathematics" being developed by Clausen and Scholze promises to make analytic geometry amenable to the powerful techniques of modern algebraic geometry. The basic objects of this theory are the "condensed sets", which may be defined as the small sheaves on the large site of compact Hausdorff spaces with the coherent topology. (These are nearly the same as the pyknotic sets of Barwick and Haine, up to issues of size.)

    In this talk we shall study several categorical properties of the category of condensed sets (which properties are surely known to the experts). We shall prove that this category is a locally small, well-powered, locally cartesian closed infinitary-pretopos, that it is neither a Grothendieck topos nor an elementary topos – since it lacks both a small generator (indeed, it is not even total) and a subobject classifier – but that it does have a large generator of finitely presentable projectives, and hence is algebraically exact. We shall also discuss the relationship of Spanier's quasi-topological spaces to condensed sets.

We recently observed that cartesian arrows can be characterized similarly in terms of the presence of certain "relative" right adjoints, aka, absolute right lifting diagrams. The classical characterization of cartesian fibrations is a more-or-less immediate corollary, by considering the generic cartesian lift of the universal arrow. This is joint work with Dominic Verity.

  abstract: |-
    Weber studied polynomials and polynomial functors in a category C with pullbacks, introducing the concept of a distributivity pullback to help describe polynomial composition. Grunenfelder and Paré explored how J-comodules, where J is a K-coalgebra, may be thought of as J-indexed families of vector spaces over a field K. Using ideas from Aguiar's PhD thesis, much of Grunenfelder and Paré's work generalises to the setting of a symmetric monoidal category with equalisers preserved by tensoring. Regarding C as a cartesian monoidal category (assuming additionally that C has a terminal object), the generalised theory of Grunenfelder and Paré for C reduces to the usual theory of C as a C-indexed category. This observation hints that the notion of polynomials and polynomial functors may generalise to the setting of sufficiently nice symmetric monoidal categories.

    Part I will introduce all of the key concepts so that we may define generalised polynomials, their associated polynomial functors, and their composition. Part II will focus on my work towards showing that the mapping from polynomials to polynomial functors is functorial, ending with a discussion of some of the needed results which don't seem to easily generalise.

    It has been 10 years since the category Lens, of categories and (delta) lenses, was introduced by Diskin, Xiong, and Czarnecki. Throughout this time, lenses have continued to be of interest to both computer scientists and category theorists alike, and much progress has been made in understanding their properties. However there are many aspects of the category Lens which remain unknown. For instance, understanding pullbacks in Lens has been important for developing a theory of symmetric lenses, yet very little is known about when they exist.

    In this talk, I will discuss recent progress made towards understanding the category Lens, including the construction of certain classes of limits and colimits, monoidal structures, and factorisations systems. The talk is based on results originating from the Applied Category Theory 2020 Adjoint School, and is joint work with Michael Johnson, Emma Chollet, Maurine Songa, Vincent Wang, and Gioele Zardini.

  title: Homotopy of product systems, K-theory of k-graph algebras, and the Yang-Baxter equation
  speaker: Aidan Sims
  date: 2021-02-24T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Online
  abstract: Higher-rank graphs, or k-graphs, are higher-dimensional analogues of directed graphs. Each k-graph can be described in terms of a coloured graph, called is skeleton, and some factorisation rules that describe how 2-coloured paths pair up into commuting squares. C*-algebras of k-graphs generalise Cuntz-Krieger algebras, and have been the subject of sustained interest essentially because questions about crossed products of C*-algebras by higher-rank free abelian groups are hard, and k-graphs algberas constitute a comparably tractable class of examples that could point the way to general theorems. A particularly obstinate question in this vein is that of determining the K-theory of a k-graph algebra; or even just whether the K-theory depends on the factorisation rules, or only on the skeleton. I'll outline some joint work with James Fletcher and Elizabeth Gillaspy that uses a homotopy argument to establish a surprising link between this question and the question of connectedness (or otherwise) of the space of solutions to a Yang-Baxter-like equation. I won't assume any background about C*-algebras, k-graphs, or the Yang-Baxter equations, and all are welcome. People who might know about connectedness (or otherwise) of the spaces of solutions to Yang-Baxter-like equations are especially welcome!

In this pair of talks, I will define a subcategory of "algebraically cofibrant" distinguished Gray-categories and construct a model structure thereon. I will show that the full subcategory of fibrant objects in this model category is the Cauchy completion of the category of Bicat-enriched categories and "computadic" normal pseudofunctors (a la Garner). In sequels to this talk, I hope to give another description of this full subcategory of fibrant objects in terms of tricategories and to prove that this model category is cartesian closed (all the better to enrich over).

  title: Lenses as coalgebras for a comonad
  speaker: Bryce Clarke
  date: 2021-04-28T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Online
  abstract: |-
    Delta lenses were first introduced as functors equipped with a suitable choice of lifts, which implies that they are functors with additional structure. Last year I showed two ways in which this structure could be obtained, through characterising the category Lens(B) of lenses over a base as both the category of algebras for a monad on Cat / B, and as the category of lax double functors from B into sMult (the double category of split multi-valued functions). However, we also know that a lens is equal parts functor and cofunctor, so it is natural to ask: is there a nice way of characterising lenses as cofunctors with additional structure?

    In this talk, I will show that the forgetful functor from the category of lenses over a base to the category of cofunctors over a base, is comonadic. This result builds upon previous work of Ahman and Uustalu, who first noticed that lenses are cofunctors with additional structure, and also introduced a construction which builds a lens from a cofunctor. Through working diagrammatically, I will also demonstrate how this result may be obtained in a more general setting (than Cat), and establish a theory of lenses (and split opfibrations) in any 1-category with pullbacks and enough structure.

  abstract: |-
    A couple of years ago I have shown that the usual Kan-Quillen model structure on simplicial sets can be shown to exists constructively. But one of the main interest of constructive mathematics is that it can be interpreted in other categories than the category of sets, for example in toposes. So, in a more recent joint work with Gambino, Sattler and Szumilo we have studied this interpretation, which give rise to what we call the "effective model structure" on the category of simplicial object sE of a countably lextensive category E.

    In this talk I will give an informal/high level overview of what goes in the proof of this constructive Kan-Quillen model structure and how it give rise to this "effective" model structure on simplicial objects. If time permits I will also talk about some results we proved about the homotopy theory of the effective model structure, and how it relates to equivariant homotopy theory and infinity categorical exact completion.

  abstract: 'In this talk I introduce my recent work on interplay between automata theory and number theory. In automata theory, it has been well known that there are tight connections between regular languages, finite monoids, and finite automata; and via such connections, one can sometimes solve decision problems on logical / combinatorial properties of regular languages by reducing them to purely algebraic problems on finite monoids. This phenomena are somewhat analogous to those known in galois theory: one can check whether solutions of a polynomial can be represented by arithmetic operations and roots by checking whether the galois group of the minimal splitting field of the polynomial is soluble. In fact, this analogy is not just an analogy but can be justified via categorical axiomatizations of the classical result in automata theory, yielding a unification of classical ideas in automata theory and galois theory. Through this unification, I also introduce some ideas of automata theory shed new light on classical (explicit) class field theory too. If time allows, I will discuss some future perspectives.'

  speaker: Soichiro Fujii

  location: Online
  abstract: The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a computational problem that includes a range of important problems in computer science. We point out that fundamental concepts of the CSP, such as the solution set of an instance and polymorphisms, can be formulated abstractly inside the 2-category PFinSet of finite sets and sets of functions between them. The 2-category PFinSet is a quantaloid, and the formulation relies mainly on structure available in any quantaloid. This observation suggests a formal development of generalisations of the CSP and concomitant notions of polymorphism in a large class of quantaloids. We extract a class of optimisation problems as a special case, and show that their computational complexity can be classified by the associated notion of polymorphism.

  abstract: Monads of probability measures, such as the distribution monad and the Giry monad, have received lots of attention in recent times. These monads are in fact sub-monads of more general signed measure monads, which despite being easier to understand, have not received any attention (as measure monads). For example, the distribution monad is a sub-monad of the familiar monad generated by the adjunction between sets and normed vector spaces, while the Giry monad is a sub-monad of the monad generated by the adjunction between measurable spaces and AL spaces. This talk will introduce the signed measure monads associated finitely supported discrete signed measures, countably supported discrete signed measures and arbitrary signed measures, with the role played by vector-valued integration in the definition of these monads highlighted.

    The category Lens of small categories and asymmetric delta lenses has surprisingly nice categorical properties. A recent study of the monos and epis in Lens has revealed that Lens has properties similar to those of a regular category, except with the notions of pullback and kernel pair replaced by their canonical proxies in Lens. Some of these properties include that

    * the proxy effective, regular, strong and extremal epics in Lens coincide (all epic lenses coequalise their proxy kernel pair and so are proxy effective);
    * the (regular) epis and monos in Lens form an orthogonal factorisation system; and,
    * image factorisations in Lens are proxy pullback stable.

  speaker: Adrian Miranda
  date: 2021-09-08T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Online
  abstract: |-
    A monad can be defined on a simplicial set X in a way which specialises to the usual definition when X is the nerve of a category. Then the weights for Kleisli and Eilenberg-Moore constructions can also be transported along N: Cat → sSet to the simplicially enriched setting. This perspective is exploited by Reihl and Verity to define homotopy coherent monads on quasicategories (and indeed in infinity cosmoses). In the first part of the talk, we will simplify the rather abstract notion of Kleisli objects to a more intuitive 'coequaliser of monoid actions'. We will give a concrete and elementary, if somewhat strange, description of the simplicially enriched Kleisli object of a monad on a simplicial set. We will see that, unlike in the Cat-enriched setting, even if we start off with an identity monad on the terminal simplicial set, we get something seemingly not as trivial out of this construction.

    In the second part of the talk, we will restrict our attention to Kleisli constructions for monads on quasi-categories. Guided by our intuition that the Kleisli object should be 'free algebras and arbitrary algebra morphisms', we will consider the essentially surjective on objects-fully faithful factorisation of the free functor of the Eilenberg-Moore adjunction. I will outline a proof for why this is a Kleilsi object for the monad, not in the sSet enriched sense but in the 'up to weak equivalence' sense. The key ingredient in our analysis will be Riehl & Verity's generalisation of Beck's monadicity theorem to the quasi-categorical setting. Our main result will be a direct generalisation to the quasi-categories setting of the standard fact that a left adjoint functor is Kleisli in the up to equivalence sense if and only if it is essentially surjective on objects. I will conclude by sharing some musings on how this might be generalised from the qCat setting to the infinity cosmos setting, possibly under the assumption of some extra structure.

  speaker: Bryce Clarke
  date: 2021-09-22T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Online
  abstract: |-
    Delta lenses are functors equipped with additional structure specifying a suitable choice of lifts. Typically delta lenses are understood as morphisms between categories, consisiting of a compatible functor and cofunctor pair. However, delta lenses also arise as objects in a category of algebras for a monad. These two approaches can be unified via a double category whose objects are categories, whose horizontal morphisms are functors, and whose vertical morphisms are delta lenses. The goal of this talk is to explore how this provides a natural context for considering generalisations of lenses.

    I will first define generalised lenses as morphisms with additional structure, working in a category equipped with an idempotent comonad and an orthogonal factorisation system (OFS); working in Cat together with the idempotent comonad for discrete categories and the comprehensive factorisation system yields the case of delta lenses. I will then show that generalised lenses retain a notion of ``suitable choice of lifts', through showing that they arise as the right class of an algebraic weak factorisation system (AWFS). This generalises a previous result where delta lenses were characterised as algebras for a monad, and also provides a way of constructing an AWFS from an OFS. Finally, as a corollary, I will show that the double category of generalised lenses is a monadic right-connected double category corresponding to the AWFS.

  location: Online
  abstract: |-
    For monads on categories, the kleisli category can be described via kleisli composition, as free algebras, or via a perhaps less well-known generators and relations presentation. In this setting, these are all isomorphic categories. Moreover, the canonical comparison functor from the kleisli category to any other adjunction splitting the same monad is fully faithful. Thus such an adjunction has the universal property in the up to equivalence sense if and only if it's left adjoint is essentially surjective on objects.

    All three of these constructions can be categorified to the two-dimensional setting but only the last one produces a 2-category with appropriate the Gray-categorical universal property. Indeed, the kleisli composition construction only categorifies to give a bicategory while with the 2-category of free pseudoalgebras one only gets a pseudofunctor FreePsAlg(A, T) → B from a pseudoalgebra for Gray(T, B): Gray(A, B) →Gray(A, B).

    The main theorem of the talk will be that the canonical comparison 2-functor from the Gray-categorical kleisli object to any other pseudoadjunction splitting the same pseudomonad is bi-fully-faithful (ie is given by equivalences between hom-categories). With this we will see that all three constructions are biequivalent, greatly simplifying the presentation. We then deduce that a pseudoadjunction is kleisli in the up to biequivalence sense if and only if it's left pseudoadjoint is biessentially surjective on objects. Armed with a property that is closed under composition, we conjecture a description of a tricategorical 'free cocompletion under kleisli objects for pseudomonads', as well as a seemingly simpler 'free completion under Elienberg Moore objects for pseudomonads'.

    This is joint work with Branko Nikolic.

    Many concepts in mathematics have relative versions. The concept applies to objects while the relative version applies to morphisms. One recaptures the original concept by specializing the domain or codomain of the relative version. Conversely, the relative version is often obtained by applying the concept to objects in a different category. In topology, proper maps relativize compactness.

    More relevant to the talk is the concept of monoid in a monoidal category which is relativized by monoidal functor. A monoidal functor $T: \mathscr D \to \mathscr C$ can be thought of as a two-sided monoid; when $\mathscr D = \mathbf 1$ it is a monoid in $\mathscr D$. Yet monoidal functors are monoids in a convolution monoidal structure. This is a one-object (yet indicative) version of categories enriched in bicategories on two sides.

    The plan is to revisit change of base in the sense of Kelly-Labella-Schmit-St using two-sided enrichment and to present our work with Branko on the topic. We consider there to be four results worthy of the title “theorem”. We also have more examples than in our earlier preprint.

  date: 2021-12-01T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Online
  abstract: In this talk I will describe an adjunction between the category of measurable spaces and the category of AL spaces with linear contractions, which generalises the adjunction between the category of sets and the category of Banach spaces with linear contractions, due to Pumplun and Rorhl (1984). The description of the counit for this adjunction requires an appropriate theory of vector-valued integration. I will demonstrate that the Pettis integral does the job. The monad generated by the adjunction sends a measurable space to the space of signed measures defined on it, with the monad unit sending each element of a measurable space to the corresponding Dirac measure on that space and the monad multiplication sending each signed measure on the space of signed measures on a measurable space to its barycenter.

  title: Proxy pullbacks in the category of lenses
  speaker: Matthew di Meglio
  date: 2021-12-15T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Online
  abstract: The category of (asymmetric delta) lenses has several surprisingly-nice categorical properties–these have been discussed in several other Australian Category Seminar talks by Clarke and myself throughout 2021. An important construction for the proofs of many of these properties is Johnson and Rosebrugh's 'pullback' of lenses, which we will call the proxy pullback of lenses, adopting this new terminology from Bumpus and Kocsis. We give a new treatment of the proxy pullback in terms of compatibility–a stronger notion of commutativity for squares of lenses. The proxy pullback is sometimes, but not always, a real pullback. Using new notions of sync-minimal and independent lens spans, we characterise when a lens span that forms a commuting square with a lens cospan has a comparison lens to a proxy pullback of the cospan.

  title: Stone and Priestley dualities via the ultrafilter and prime filter monads
  speaker: Eli Hazel
  date: 2021-12-15T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Online
  abstract: |-
    Classical Stone duality is the dual equivalence between the categories of Boolean algebras and totally disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces, that is, Stone spaces. In the late 1960s, Manes proved that the algebras for the ultrafilter monad are precisely compact Hausdorff spaces. The ultrafilter monad is induced by the contravariant powerset functor, regarded as a functor from the category of sets to Boolean algebras, and its adjoint, which takes a Boolean algebra to its set of ultrafilters.

    In the first part of this talk, we will outline a proof of the equivalence between the categories of algebras for the ultrafilter monad and compact Hausdorff spaces. We will then use Dubuc's adjoint triangle theorem to construct a left adjoint to the induced comparison functor from Boolean algebras to compact Hausdorff spaces; by restricting this adjunction in a canonical way, we obtain classical Stone duality.

    Priestley duality refers to the dual equivalence between the categories of distributive lattices and Priestley spaces, a category of partially ordered spaces with a separation condition reminiscient of that of Stone spaces. In 1997, Flagg proved that the category of (partially) ordered compact Hausdorff spaces is equivalent to the category of algebras for the prime filter monad, a monad on the category of ordered sets. In the second part of this talk, we will show how we extend the machinery developed in the first half to derive Priestley duality by way of the prime filter monad.

  speaker: Nicola di Vittorio
  date: 2022-02-09T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: Pasting diagrams are a very useful device to express composition in higher categories. In the literature there are a number of results on the uniqueness of pastings, starting from John Power’s pasting theorem for 2-categories. For non-strict higher categories there is usually extra work to be done to address various layers of coherence. In this talk I will go through the proof of a pasting theorem for Gray-categories, which gives a foundation to some aspects of the theory of higher derivators I’ve been developing. This is joint work with Dominic Verity.

  abstract: After my talk to Categories and Companions on Thurs 10 Jun 2021 about Mackey functors, one of the questions was whether I knew about the recent work on Mackey 2-functors. No I had not. Soon after that, Mathematical Reviews asked me whether I would be willing to review the book referred to in the title of this talk. I agreed and now would like to give some idea of what the book is about. (The talk is dedicated to the memory of Jean Bénabou whose concept of bicategory and example of spans are essential to the book.)

  title: Some facts about sound classes of weights
  speaker: Giacomo Tendas
  date: 2022-03-02T14:00:00.000Z

  abstract: In this talk I will consider the (enriched) notions of sound and weakly-sound classes of weights, first introduced in the ordinary setting by Adamek, Borceux, Lack, and Rosicky. We'll see (1) that these two notions are actually equivalent in many cases and (2) that a sound class \Phi is all you need to obtain a theory of locally \Phi-presentable V-categories, even if V is not locally presentable itself but just locally bounded. The class Q of the Cauchy weights will play an important role in (2), in particular we'll obtain a new proof of the fact that Q is a small class whenever V is locally presentable (this was first shown by Scott Johnson in 1989).

  title: Abstract Kleisli Structures
  speaker: Adrian Miranda
  date: 2022-03-23T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Abstract Kleisli Structures are used in computer science to model call by value programming languages with effects. As the name suggests, they abstract away certain structure which is always present on the Kleisli category of a monad. When the unit of the monad satisfies a certain equalising condition, the original monad can be recovered from the abstract Kleisli structure on its Kleisli category. In the literature, this is made precise by exhibiting abstract kleisli structures as objects of a full reflective subcategory of a category whose objects are monads.

    As far as I have been able to find in the literature though, only strict morphisms between monads are considered and neither of the two possible notions of 2-cells of monads are considered. In the first part of this talk I will review the existing literature and fill these gaps. In the second part of this talk I will define abstract kleilsi structures on 2-categories and show how the results generalise to the pseudomonad setting.

  title: A survey on saturated and pre-saturated classes of colimits
  speaker: Giacomo Tendas
  date: 2022-04-06T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: Let Î¦ be a class of (indexing) categories; we say that Î¦ is saturated if for any small category C the existence and preservation of C-colimits is implied by that of Î¦-colimits. We say Î¦ is pre-saturated if for any category C, every object X of Î¦C (the free cocompletion of C under Î¦-colimits) is a Î¦-colimit of elements of C. When one replaces categories with weights (as it usually happens in the enriched context), it's easy to see that every saturated class is pre-saturated; however the same result (to my knowledge) is not that easy to prove when Î¦ is a class of categories. The aim of this talk is to give some examples of non-pre-saturated, pre-saturated (but not saturated) and saturated classes of colimits, and to provide a proof of the fact that every saturated class of categories is pre-saturated. At the end we'll see that a pre-saturated class is saturated if and only if it is closed under 'codomains of final functors'.

  title: Bisimulation versus trace equivalence
  speaker: Richard Garner
  date: 2022-04-13T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    A labelled transition system with label-set B comprises a set of states S together with an operation which to each state from S, non-deterministically assigns an output symbol in B and a new state in S. A probabilistic generative system is the same thing, except that the non-deterministic assignment above becomes a probabilistic one.

    For labelled transition systems and probabilistic generative systems, there are many different meaningful notions of equivalence between states; the extremal choices are bisimulation equivalence and trace equivalence. It is well known that two states of a system are bisimilar if they become the same under the unique map to the final such system. On the other hand, a line of research, started by Power–Turi, and developed further by Hasuo, Jacobs and Sokolova, characterises trace equivalence in terms of equality under the unique map to a terminal object in a suitable Kleisli category.

    We propose a refinement of the Power–Turi–Hasuo–Jacobs–Sokolova theory, which instead characterises trace equivalence in terms of a terminal object in a suitable category of Eilenberg–Moore algebras. For the examples listed above, this recovers the full infinitary trace given by closed sets of B^N (for labelled transition systems) and probability distributions on B^N (for probabilistic generative systems).

  title: Bi-accessible and bipresentable 2-categories
  speaker: Axel Osmond
  date: 2022-04-27T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: We develop a 2-dimensional version of accessibility and presentability compatible with the recent formalism of flat pseudofunctors. First we give prerequisites on the different notions of 2-dimensional colimits, filteredness and cofinality; in particular we show that sigma-filteredness (in the sense of Descotte-Dubuc-Szyld) and bifilteredness (in the sense of Kennisson) are actually equivalent in practice for our purposes. Then, we define bi-accessible and bipresentable 2-categories in terms of bicompact objects and bifiltered bicolimits. We then characterize them as categories of flat pseudofunctors. We also prove a bi-accessible right bi-adjoint functor theorem and deduce a 2-dimensional Gabriel-Ulmer duality relating small bilex 2-categories and finitely bipresentable 2-categories. Finally, we show that 2-categories of pseudo-algebras of finitary pseudomonads on Cat are finitely bipresentable, which in particular captures the case of Lex, the 2-category of small lex categories. Invoking Garner and Lack technology of lex-colimits, we prove further that several 2-categories arising in categorical logic (Reg, Ex, Coh, Ext, Adh, Pretop) are also finitely bipresentable.

  abstract: There are a pair of theorems about concrete categories from the early 70s, by Freyd and Kučera, both of which are proved by assuming the axiom of global choice, and well-ordering the class of objects. Kučera's proof even starts by assuming blithely that the objects of the arbitrary starting category *are* ordinals. Martti Karvonen and I have improved these theorems to hold in the choiceless setting, and to work in algebraic set theory (albeit with classical logic) rather than traditional material set theory.

In my talk, I will introduce the new notion of a monoidal-extensive symmetric monoidal fibration. This notion specialises to the familiar notion of extensive fibration when the monoidal product on the total category of the fibration is cartesian monoidal. I will also explain why the functor that sends a symmetric monoidal category with nice equalisers to its associated comodule fibration is right adjoint to the functor that sends a monoidal-extensive symmetric monoidal fibration with nice fibred equalisers to its underlying symmetric monoidal category.

  speaker: John Power
  date: 2022-05-25T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: 'A little over 20 years ago, there were two concerted attempts to use sophisticated category theory to model binding in programming languages. One, by Gabbay and Pitts, uses the Schanuel topos and is particularly well suited to Milner''s pi-calculus. The other, by Fiore, Plotkin and Turi, initially models substitution, that forming the technical heart of their work, with their modelling of binders flowing from it. Unbeknown to them at the time, pseudo-monads are central to their work, which is particularly well suited to the lambda calculus; and the setting of pseudo-monads allows their work to be extended routinely to several valuable variants of the lambda calculus. I wrote a string of papers about the situation with Miki Tanaka over a period of several years. I propose to outline the key ideas: the mathematics is simple for AusCat but the application to programming might be new and of interest to you.'

  speaker: Soichiro Fujii
  date: 2022-06-01T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: It is known that for any monoidal category V and a monoid T in V, the slice category V/T has a natural monoidal structure, and that there exists a canonical isomorphism of categories between Mon(V/T) and Mon(V)/T. If we regard the monoid T as a lax monoidal functor from the terminal monoidal category to V, then V/T is characterised as the oplax limit of the 1-cell T, in the 2-category of monoidal categories, lax monoidal functors and monoidal natural transformations. In this talk, I will generalise the construction of V/T as follows. For any bicategory W and a category B enriched over W, I will define a bicategory W/B, for which there exists a canonical isomorphism between the 2-categories (W/B)-CAT and (W-CAT)/B. The bicategory W/B can be characterised as the oplax limit of the W-category B, regarded as a lax functor from a suitable indiscrete category to W, in the 2-category of bicategories, lax functors and icons.

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: A "natural model of (homotopy) type theory" was defined, in a 2017 paper by Awodey, to be a map of presheaves equipped with extra structure which allows one to interpret Martin-LÃ¶f intensional type theory. At the base level, a natural model of type theory is a representable natural transformation, equipped with a choice of representation for each fiber. This map can then be associated with additional natural transformations capturing the dependent product, dependent sum and intensional identity type constructors of Martin-LÃ¶f type theory. In this expository talk I will give a rundown of Martin-LÃ¶f type theory, and then very motivate Awodey's definition, explaining the content of the first part of the paper. Time permitting, I will talk briefly on how to construct natural models, and their relationship with model structures.

    Last year I gave some talks describing how (finitary) cartesian closed varieties can be identified with pairs of a Boolean algebra B and a monoid M which act on each other in a certain way: I call this a matched pair [B|M].

    In this talk we get into the nitty gritty of this, by describing the variety to which such a matched pair [B|M] corresponds; this is the titular variety of [B|M]-sets. We will see explicitly why [B|M]-sets form a cartesian closed category, and describe simple conditions under which they form a topos; and under which the forgetful functor from [B|M]-sets to [B|1]-sets is a closed functor.

The leading examples of this account of binders are given by the lambda calculus, which, in regard to binders, is not much different to first order logic; the linear lambda calculus; and the Logic of Bunched Implications. And the relationship between the two notions of signature is non-trivial: in Plotto''s finite product setting, his signatures are included among the Max et al ones; but in the more general situation, they are not, I think in an interesting way.'

    (joint work with Branko Nikoli\'c) The paper on which my 1 July 2020 talk was based is totally revised.

    The subject arose from our feeling that work of Turaev and Virelizier [TV] on categorical structures graded by a group should exemplify the general theory of monoidal centres. The present talk will concentrate more on the general theory than the [TV] case. Our 2020 arXiv preprint <arxiv.org/abs/2010.10656> made various claims about higher Davydov full centres with scant detail. Our revised version gives the much needed detail and that is what I hope to share in my talk.

    In this talk, we explain how the topological comodels of any (finitary) algebraic theory T are the continuous left B-sets for a certain topological category B, called the topological behaviour category. We compute these topological behaviour categories explicitly for various theories of interest.

    If time permits, we explain how this gives rise to a Galois adjunction between topological categories and algebraic theories, whose fixpoints are, to one side, the source-etale topological categories with Stone space of objects; and, to the other, the algebraic theories with cartesian closed category of models.

There has long been a fine body of research about sketches, providing a graphical notion of presentation, contrasting with logical or algebraic such notions. It has traditionally been based on limits and colimits, e.g., finite product sketches, finite limit sketches and geometric sketches. But what about monoidal examples? or binders? I wanted to include the following: given any finitary monad T, equivalently algebraic structure or Lawvere Cat-theory, on Cat or variants, define and develop a notion of T-sketch. So I shall discuss a general setting. In particular, we can define T-sketch and T-model for a finitary monad T on an lfp category C, then prove that every T-sketch has a generic T-model.'

In this talk, I provide an explicit construction of the completion of a double category under the property of right-connectedness. Several properties of the right-connected completion are studied, including when its category of morphisms arises as a category of (co)algebras. If a double category has companions, it is also shown that its right-connected completion behaves like a lax limit in the 2-category of double categories, lax double functors, and horizontal transformations. Several examples will be presented throughout the talk, with a particular focus on applications to the theory of lenses.

  abstract: Let bbF be a finite field, let scrF be the category of finite dimensional vector spaces and linear functions over bbF, and let scrG be the subcategory of scrF with all the objects and only the bijective linear functions. Let scrV be the category of vector spaces over the complex numbers (say). André Joyal and I studied a monoidal structure on the functor category [scrG,scrV] as recorded in our publication [49]. So I was quite interested and surprised when Nicholas Kuhn told Steve Lack and me about his equivalence of categories [scrF,scrV] \simeq [scrG,scrV] when we were discussing Dold-Kan-type theorems. The proof depends on a remarkable piece of linear algebra by our late ANU colleague Laci Kováks. Given Kováks' result (1992), I am studying the rest of the argument. It is at a fairly early stage but that has not in the past stopped me from giving a premature talk!

When these functors and colimits are allowed to be lax/oplax the result is something similar to the Fam construction. We might call it the 'op/lax Fam construction'. The op/lax Fam construction also bears similarity to the co/Kleisli completion, which it contains as a full subcategory. I'll describe this construction, mention some interesting properties, and give examples.

  speaker: Adrian Miranda
  date: 2022-07-27T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Gray-categories are "semi-strict three-dimensional categories", in the sense that every tricategory is triequivalent to a Gray-category. In this talk I will introduce a closed structure [-, ?] on Gray-Cat, the category of Gray-categories. The objects of [A, B] will be Gray-functors, while the morphisms will be (finite composites of) trinatural transformations satisfying a certain "semi-strictness" property. This semi-strictness property asks for the usual unit and composition laws for a pseudonatural transformation to hold on the nose rather than just up to some invertible 3-cell. As I will show, an arbitrary trinatural transformation between Gray functors out of a cofibrant Gray category is appropriately equivalent to a semi-strict one.

    There is also a monoidal structure \otimes on Gray-Cat due to Crans, but for general reasons due to Bourke and Gurski these structures cannot be combined to a monoidal closed structure. Instead, I will identify conditions on Gray categories A_1, ...., A_n so that multimaps A_1, ..., A_n → B agree for both structures, and I will describe an embedding between the two 2-categories of enriched categories, ie. a 2-fully faithful map \otimes-Cat → [-, ?]-Cat. Time permitting I will share some progress towards proving a developing conjecture on a coherence result in dimension four. I will also explain why I think even if the conjecture is true, the techniques from this talk will not be sufficient to define a similar "closed structure of semi-strict maps" on the category of semi-strict four categories.

  abstract: Last week we looked at a 'highlights reel' of the proof that there is a closed structure on Gray-Cat. We saw which bits were easier, which bits were harder, and in what ways. The first thing I'll do this week is give some more detail about how conducting those 'tedious diagram chases' is a more algorithmic and less creative activity than you might think. After this, we'll compare categories enriched over Crans' monoidal structure to categories enriched over the closed structure. We'll see that the fully general notion of a category enriched over the closed structure has some unappealing non-algebraic features, and identify a niceness assumption under which they will be better behaved. We'll also look at degenerate cases including (in decreasing order of degeneracy) symmetric monoidal categories, braided Gray monoids, and the (possibly new?) notion of a monoidal Gray category. We'll see that there is some asymmetry in the notion of a category enriched over the closed structure, even with the niceness assumption. This asymmetry disappears for symmetric monoidal categories, but it has already been noticed by Baez and Neuchl, as well as by Crans, in the context of braided Gray monoids.

I will then show how one can interpolate the category of representation of the automorphism groups of the structures by interpolation of the invariants of the algebraic structures. In this way we recover the constructions of Deligne for categories such as Rep(S_t), Rep(O_t) and Rep(Sp_t), the constructions of Knop for wreath products with S_t, and GL_t(O_r), where O_r is a finite quotient of a discrete valuation ring. We will also show how the TQFT categories recently constructed from a rational function by Khovanov, Ostrik, and Kononov arise in this context.

    In previous talks I outlined how strictification in dimensions 2 and 3 can be broken into several steps.

    1. Read off generating data (ie a directed graph/2-computad) from the weak-n-category (ie bicategory/tricategory) A.

    2. Freely construct the fragment of the semi-strict n category containing only k < n dimensional cells (ie category/sesquicategory).

    3. Form a discrete semi-strict n category on that, call it D(A).

    4. Pick an arbitrary but consistent way of evaluating n-1 cells.

  date: 2022-11-09T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: An ordered semiring is a commutative semiring equipped with a compatible preorder. The notion of ordered semiring generalises those of distributive lattice and of commutative ring, and enables us to unify certain aspects of lattice theory and ring theory. The ideals of an ordered semiring A form an integral commutative quantale Idl(A), and similarly, the radical ideals of A form a (spatial) frame Rad(A). We characterise Idl and Rad as the left adjoints of the forgetful functors from the categories of integral commutative quantales and of frames to that of ordered semirings and subadditive morphisms between them. The (sober) topological space pt(Rad(A)) = Spec(A) corresponding to Rad(A) is a space of prime ideals of A.

One proposed by Leinster, based on an idea of Batanin's, defines weak ω-categories as the algebras for a particular monad on the category of globular sets. Intuitively, this monad encodes only the existence part of the pasting theorem for globular pasting diagrams. In this talk, I will make precise (and sketch a proof of) the uniqueness part, and discuss some of its applications.

  abstract: Deformation cohomology of tensor categories describe (first order) infinitesimal deformations of tensor categories, tensor functors and tensor natural transformations. In a recent paper Gainutdinov, Haferkamp and Schweigert showed that for a finite tensor category the deformation cohomology coincides with the self-extension groups in the monoidal centre. This fact can be used to prove vanishing of the deformation cohomology (Ocneanu rigidity) for fusion categories. In the talk I will report on the joint project with R. Street, which aims at extending the above results and provides other vanishing results for deformation cohomology.

We show that all of the natural transformations in our diagrams arise by iteratively taking mates of identity natural transformations. We then iteratively apply the double functoriality of the mates correspondence — a classical theorem of Kelly and Street — to reduce our pasted composites of mates to pasted composites of identity natural transformations, which self-evidently commute.

  date: 2023-02-01T16:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    In the 1970's, Graham Higman gave a description of Thompson's group V as
    the automorphism group of the free Jonsson–Tarski algebra with one
    generator, where a Jonsson–Tarski algebra is a set X endowed with an
    isomorphism to X * X.

    Higman's original approach was to calculate this free algebra
    explicitly, and via some combinatorics present its automorphism group V
    in a more tractable way. Subsequently, it has become popular to describe
    V in terms of certain maps between ideals of the free monoid on two
    generators {l,r}, and this requires further combinatorics to equate with
    Higman's description. In this talk, we explain why the combinatorics are
    unneccessary: we can get the ideal-theoretic description almost
    trivially from Freyd's description of the category of Jonsson–Tarski
    algebras as a category of sheaves.

    This talk is mostly a response to Mike's from last week. I won't have colourful props but we might see a coloured PROP in the sense of [1] as part of a counterexample.

    I'll discuss some of the subtleties involved in the combinatorics of n-dimensional paths for small n. For n =1 we get ordinary paths while for n=2 the definition makes well-definedness and uniqueness of a pasting easy to recognise, despite uniqueness often failing to hold. These are 2-cells in free sesquicategories on 2-computads.

    When n=3 we will meet the formal interchangers which John mentioned in the discussion after Mike's talk. Just as generating 3-cells in Gray computads are between parallel 2-paths, generating 4-cells in "weak interchange 4-computads" (to be introduced) will be defined between parallel 3-paths. These 3-paths will be built out of generating 3-cells, as well as those formal interchangers. As an example, I'll give a presentation for the free living triadjunction.

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Approximation, Serre duality and recollements are three major tools, theories really, used to study triangulated categories in algebraic geometry and representation theory. However, the existence of Serre duality is a very strong condition; the bounded derived category of a finite dimensional algebra satisfies Serre duality if and only if it has finite global dimension. Replacing Serre duality by the weaker notion of a partial Serre functor, we get a new tool which applies to any approximable category, and in particular to any ring.

    In this talk, I will explain how these tools interact. I will briefly (and badly) introduce Neeman's theory of approximation for triangulated categories, and show how approximability and Serre functors behave under recollements.

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Bicategorical limits and colimits have a well developed theory, and are related to homotopically well-behaved limits and colimits enriched over Cat as a monoidal model category. Given a diagram F: A → B and a weight W: A → Cat, new data F': A' → B' and W': A' → Cat can be described so that the original bilimit {W, F}, if it exists, is an `up to equivalence' version of an enriched limit of F' weighted by W'. The enriched weights needed to model bicategorical notions are the projectively cofibrant ones; those which can be built out of representables using coproducts, coinserters, coequifiers and splittings of idempotents.

    There is also a monoidal model structure on Gray, and one might hope to similarly develop a theory of tricategorical limits and colimits, and relate it to homotopically well-behaved notions enriched over Gray. There are some extra subtleties involved in achieving this, largely due to the fact that not all 2-categories are cofibrant. As such, the categorifications of many familiar results about bicategorical limits and colimits require extra assumptions. These assumptions include pointwise cofibrancy of weights and hom-wise cofibrancy of shapes. In these talks I will describe some progress towards developing this theory.

    In this talk, I will discuss combinatorial structures used to present the game semantics for a free cartesian closed category (ccc), as outlined in my MRes thesis. Specifically, I will explain how the game semantics of a free ccc corresponds to a known representation of a free ccc called the ccc-calculus. This correspondence is achieved by introducing invertible constants into the ccc-calculus, resulting in a natural and intuitive connection between game semantics and the theory of long beta-eta normal forms. The proof technique employed in this account is relatively easy to understand and visualise, providing a clearer account of the free case compared to existing literature. Additionally, I will give a novel approach to computing long beta-eta normal forms in the context of this correspondence. If time permits, I will also touch upon potential generalisations of this work that are currently in a conjectural stage.

    This is the second talk I have given in this seminar about my MRes work, the first being in July 2022. Having since submitted my thesis, I would now like to give a more comprehensive description of these ideas.

  abstract: |-
    The notion of a Moore-Penrose inverse (M-P inverse) was introduced by Moore in 1920 and rediscovered by Penrose in 1955. The M-P inverse of a complex matrix is a special type of inverse which is unique, always exists, and can be computed using singular value decomposition. In a series of papers in the 1980s, Puystjens and Robinson studied M-P inverses more abstractly in the context of dagger categories. Despite the fact that dagger categories are now a fundamental notion in many areas, the notion of a M-P inverse has not (to our knowledge) been revisited since their work. One purpose of this research project is to renew the study of M-P inverses in dagger categories.

    In this talk, I will discuss the notion of a Moore-Penrose dagger category and provide many examples. I will also discuss generalized versions of
    singular value decomposition, compact singular value decomposition, and polar decomposition for maps in a dagger category, and show how,
    having such a decomposition is equivalent to having M-P inverses.

  abstract: |-
    A traced monad is a monad on a traced monoidal category that lifts the traced monoidal structure to its Eilenberg-Moore category. A long standing question has been trying to provide a characterization of traced monads without explicitly mentioning the Eilenberg-Moore category. On the other hand, a Hopf monad is a comonoidal monad whose fusions operators are invertible. Furthermore, for compact closed categories, a Hopf monad is precisely the kind of monad on a compact closed category that lifts the compact closed structure to its Eilenberg-Moore category. Since every compact closed category is also a traced monoidal category, a natural question to ask is what is the relationship between Hopf monads and traced monads. In this talk, I will discuss the trace-coherence condition for Hopf monads, which can be stated without mentioning the Eilenberg-Moore category. The main result being that a Hopf monad is traced if and only if it satisfies the trace-coherence condition. I will also discuss examples of traced/Hopf monads that are not Hopf/traced monads.

The category Open has all small colimits created by the inclusion Open → Ord, but the inclusion functor does not seem to have a right adjoint. We impose a suitable size condition (relative to a cardinal κ) on preordered sets and obtain a full subcategory Open(κ) of Open. Then the inclusion functor Open(κ) → Ord does have a right adjoint, whose value at a preordered set is constructed by quotienting a set of ''Kripke models'' under ''bisimilarity''.

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    Monads have many useful applications both in mathematics and in computer science. Notably they provide a convenient way to describe computational side-effects. An important question is how to handle several instances of such side-effects or a graded collection of them. The usual approach consists in defining many 'small' monads and combining them together using distributive laws.

    In this talk, we take a different approach and look for a pre-existing internal structure to a monoidal category that allows us to develop a fine-graining of monads. We call the monads obtained "localisable". This uses techniques from tensor topology and provides an intrinsic theory of local computational effects without needing to know how the constituent effects interact beforehand. In this talk we introduce notions in tensor topology, define localisable monads, and show how they are equivalent to monads in a specific 2-category. To motivate the talk, we will also consider an application to the modelling of concurrent systems.

    In 2013, Krause defined a new product of strict polynomial functors, with various applications including a new construction of Ringel and Serre duality for the category of strict polynomial functors.


    The category of strict polynomial functors is equivalent to a limit of categories of polynomial representations of general linear groups. Such
    categories have been studied enormously, beginning with the work of Schur in 1901. Still it was not obvious without the tools of category theory
    that such a product should exist for polynomial representations of the general linear group.

    In this talk we give a new construction of Krause's product using only the classical theory of polynomial representations of general linear groups
    i.e. only using tools available to Schur in 1901. We will outline the anachronistic derivation of this construction from Krause's product.

    A function $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ may encode a system whose output at a given time depends only on its input at that time. A natural generalisation involves shift-invariant operators $\ell^2(\mathbb{R}) \to \ell^2(\mathbb{R})$, which may encode systems whose output at a given time depends on its input at all preceding times. One can reasonably ask what happens to the differential calculus in this situation. Well: ordinary derivatives are replaced by Frechet derivatives; and Taylor series are replaced by so-called Volterra series.

    This talk will sketch the general theory with a vagueness that would make a functional analyst wince; the point really being to provide grist for a category theorist who fancied turning the whole business into combinatorics or profunctor calculus.

Then we will discuss generalisations to the two-dimensional setting, now involving pseudomonads on semi-strict monoidal 2-categories, aka Gray monoids.

The Kleisli category of the classifying monad is isomorphic to the classified restriction category. Is there anything interesting we can say about the algebras of the classifying monad? In general it doesn't appear so! However for many important examples of classified restriction categories, such as the category of sets and partial functions, the Eilenberg-Moore category of the classifying monad is equivalent to the Kleisli category. I will give a restriction category explanation for why this is the case by using restriction idempotents and relating them to B. Jacobs' notion of bases for algebras in 'Bases as Coalgebras'.

One of the major developments is the notion of incompressible categories, which take over the role played by the category of (super)vector spaces in characteristic zero.

  abstract: An orthogonal factorization system (OFS) can be regarded as a cartesian fibration, while a cartesian equipment naturally gives rise to a cartesian fibration as well. We establish sufficient conditions for a cartesian equipment to induce an orthogonal factorisation system as a cartesian fibration. On the other hand, Shulman introduced a way to obtain an equipment from a monoidal bifibration, and we observe applying it to a stable OFS results in a cartesian equipment. This construction generalises the cartesian equipment of relations, and the outcome is termed the cartesian equipment of relations relative to a stable OFS. Lastly, we note that by appropriately strengthening the conditions for a cartesian equipment to induce an OFS, we precisely identify the class of cartesian equipments of relations relative to stable OFSs.

  title: A groupoid approach to regular *-semigroups
  speaker: James East
  date: 2024-01-17T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    A cornerstone of inverse semigroup theory is the Ehresmann–Schein–Nambooripad Theorem, which states that the category of inverse
    semigroups is isomorphic to the category of inductive groupoids. This was generalised to regular semigroups by Nambooripad in his legendary
    1979 memoir. In this pair of talks we will discuss our recent work on the intermediate class of regular *-semigroups. These semigroups have an
    involution, but their idempotents need not commute; key examples include partition, Brauer and Temperley–Lieb monoids. The role of the
    biordered set of idempotents is played by certain unary algebras of projections, and various categorical structures built on them.

    The first talk (James) will develop the theory, and focus on the main result of our recent paper (Adv Math, 2024): the category of regular
    *-semigroups is isomorphic to the category of (what we call) chained projection groupoids.

    The second talk (Azeef) will cover an interesting consequence, namely the existence of free (idempotent- and projection-generated) regular
    *-semigroups. Specifically, the forgetful functor RSS → PA (where these are the categories of regular *-semigroups and projection algebras) has a
    left adjoint PA → RSS. At the object level, the adjoint constructs a so-called chain semigroup $C_P$ from a projection algebra $P$, wherein $C_P$ is
    realised as a quotient of a free category arising from $P$. This utilises what we call linked pairs of projections (which are analogous to
    Nambooripad’s singular squares in biordered sets). We shall also glimpse the special cases of various diagram monoids, and if time permits we
    will discuss recent and ongoing joint work with Robert Gray (East Anglia) and Nik Ruskuc (St Andrews) in this direction.

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: The fundamental theorem of category theory is the Yoneda lemma, which in its simplest form identifies natural transformations between represented functors with morphisms between the representing objects. The ∞-categorical Yoneda lemma is surprisingly hard to prove — at least in the traditional set-based foundations of mathematics. In this talk we’ll describe the experience of developing ∞-category theory in an alternate foundation system based on homotopy type theory, in which constructions determined up to a contractible space of choices are genuinely “well-defined” and elementwise mappings are automatically homotopically-coherently functorial. In this setting the proof the ∞-categorical Yoneda lemma is arguably easier than the 1-categorical Yoneda lemma. We’ll end by posing the question as to whether similar foundations would be useful for other “higher structures." This is based on joint work with Mike Shulman and involves computer formalizations written in collaboration with Nikolai Kudasov and Jonathan Weinberger.

  abstract: 'Algebraic geometry, synthetic differential geometry, and differential geometry are all geometrical theories devoted to capturing some notion of differentiability. In the same way as a category provides a common language to study mathematical entities, a tangent category provides a minimal context to develop geometrical theories concerned with infinitesimals and local linear behaviours. So far, tangent category theory proved to be up to this challenge by providing models for all of these three theories. But what about noncommutative geometry? The noncommutative geometry program is devoted to interpreting associative algebras as geometrical spaces. Even though noncommutative geometry shares lots of commonalities with the other mentioned theories, noncommutative spaces lack a classical notion of points so, it is not a trivial question asking whether or not tangent categories could be employed in this setting. In this talk, I will present a joint work with Sacha Ikonicoff (University of Ottawa) and JS Lemay (Macquarie University) in which we provided the first nontrivial example of a tangent category for (algebraic) noncommutative geometry. Our approach is far more general: we showed that for any operad, the corresponding category of affine schemes, which is the opposite of the category of algebras of the operad, comes equipped with a tangent structure. In this first part, I aim to introduce the fundamentals of tangent category theory and discuss the notion of tangent monads and operads.'

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    In his PhD thesis and subsequent papers, Lawvere gave a finite axiomatization of the properties of
    function composition. Known as the elementary theory of the category of sets (ETCS), this framework can
    be used to describe many set theoretical constructions used in everyday mathematical practice. The main
    gap between ETCS and traditional foundations such as ZFC is the axiom of replacement, which allows
    more sophisticated constructions such as transfinite recursion.

    Lawvere also called for a similar axiomatization of the two-dimensional structure of categories, functors,
    and natural transformations. In this talk I will describe a characterisation of 2-categories Cat(E) of
    categories internal to a model of ETCS. This builds upon Bourke’s characterisation of Cat(E) when E just
    has pullbacks. The resulting theory is the elementary theory of the 2-category of small categories
    (ET2CSC) of the title. The main result is that the 2-categories of models of ETCS and ET2CSC are
    biequivalent.

    Time permitting (or in a follow up talk!), I will also describe how the two-dimensional setting supports a
    convenient way of incorporating the axiom of replacement, albeit in a non-elementary way. This uses
    Weber’s discrete opfibration classifiers and is inspired by the categories of small maps from algebraic set
    theory.

  abstract: We look at the possibility of extending the work of Coecke, Pavlovic, Vicary and others on the theory of quantum sets to infinite-dimensions. In previous work, those authors showed that the category of commutative dagger-Frobenius algebras in the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces is equivalent to the category of finite sets. This allows one to have a notion of finite set in more general monoidal categories. But the extension of these ideas to infinite dimensions requires new structures. I’m going to suggest that Ehrhard’s finiteness spaces are a sensible possibility. Rather than Hilbert spaces, one works in a category of Lefschetz topological spaces, which give a *-autonomous category of topological vector spaces. This work is a summary of ongoing discussions with J.S.Lemay.

  abstract: Recently Vaughan Jones developed a powerful tool to diagrammatically construct actions of groups permitting a calculus of fractions. One particular application leads to a rich family of infinite-dimensional representations of the celebrated Thompson group F and the Cuntz algebra O2. In this talk, we will reveal a surprisingly strong rigidity theorem between subcategories of Rep(F) and Rep(O2). We will also see how to reduce very difficult questions concerning irreducibility and equivalence of infinite-dimensional representations into problems in finite-dimensional linear algebra. This will allow to show that the irreducible classes of dimension d form a moduli space of real manifold dimension 2d2+1. Finally, we introduce the first known tensor product for a large class of representations of the Cuntz algebra. This tensor product has many properties reminiscent of the classical tensor product, and endows a tensor category structure on a subcategory of Rep(O2) which consists of infinite-dimensional representations.

  speaker: Marcello Lanfranchi

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    The Grothendieck construction establishes an equivalence between fibrations, a.k.a. fibred categories, and indexed categories, and is one of the fundamental results of category theory. Cockett and Cruttwell introduced the notion of fibrations in the context of tangent categories and proved that the fibres of a tangent fibration inherit a tangent structure from the total tangent category. The main goal of this talk is to provide a Grothendieck construction for tangent fibrations. Our first attempt will focus on providing a correspondence between tangent fibrations and indexed tangent categories, which are collections of tangent categories and tangent morphisms indexed by the objects and morphisms of a base tangent category. We will show that this construction inverts Cockett and Cruttwell’s result but it does not provide a full equivalence between these two concepts. In order to understand how to define a genuine Grothendieck equivalence in the context of tangent categories, we introduce a new concept: the formal notion of tangent objects. Tangent objects play a similar role in tangent category theory as formal monads for monad theory. We show that tangent fibrations arise as tangent objects of a suitable 2-category and we employ this characterization to lift the Grothendieck construction between fibrations and indexed categories to a genuine Grothendieck equivalence between tangent fibrations and tangent indexed categories. I want to thank Geoff Cruttwell for introducing me to the world of fibrations, and I also would like to thank Dorette Pronk and Geoff Vooys for the stimulating discussions about the Grothendieck construction.

  title: Algebraic deformation and tangent categories
  speaker: Marcello Lanfranchi
  date: 2024-03-27T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Macquarie
  abstract: In the algebraic approach to Quantum Mechanics, the observables of a system, i.e. the physical quantities one can measure of a system, are mathematically represented by a *-algebra, which is an associative Banach algebra with an involution map. Employing the celebrated theorem of Gelfand and Najmark one can show that commutative *-algebras formalize classical observables, while non-commutative ones represent the observables of a quantum system. In the algebraic approach, usually, one starts with a well-known classical theory and builds a non-commutative version of the corresponding commutative *-algebra. This technique of building noncommutative algebras from commutative ones is called deformation quantization and it is based on the principles of deformation theory. Deformation theory aims to construct algebraic objects of some type, e.g. associative algebras, starting from other ones, in a controlled way, so that one can restore the original objects by “killing” some extra terms. This construction, in my opinion, can be interpreted geometrically. In this talk, I would like to discuss some ideas and intuitions I developed to employ tangent category theory to interpret geometrically the deformation of an algebraic object. In particular, I will show that the category of operad is itself a tangent category, whose vector fields are related to infinitesimal deformations of the corresponding algebras.

These groups are interesting on their own, satisfying exceptional properties and having powerful extra-structures for studying them. They are isotropy subgroup of forest-skein categories: categories of planar diagrams mod out by certain skein relations (just like planar algebras are in Jones’ subfactor framework).

At the end of my second talk, Steve asked whether there is a natural mathematical reason for the definition as stated. I could not answer then, and I still cannot. However, although I stated the key theorem that a binding signature must satisfy, I did not explain the proof, which I regarded, and still regard, as remarkably delicate. So I propose to give a little background in order to make the motivation for the calculation somewhat comprehensible, then try to explain the proof. My hope is that one of you, or I, might see a more conceptual formulation of binding signature that reflects the theorem. Nobody other than Marcelo Fiore seems to have done much with Plotto et al’s work, but I think it was fine work that merits thought.

  location: Macquarie
  abstract: |-
    In general (universal) algebra, a concrete clone describes algebraic structure in terms of the operations available on a fixed base set. Further, concrete clones may be regarded as representations of abstract clones, known to be equivalent to Lawvere's algebraic theories in category theory.  Relational clones arise as fixpoints of a Galois connection (adjunction) between operations and relations on a base set; concrete clones are the fixpoints on the other side. When the base set is finite, clones and coclones form dually isomorphic lattices — a duality between clones of operations and clones of relations. We will present our work on a category theoretic treatment of this situation in talks over two consecutive weeks:

    Part I. Syntactic categories and functorial semantics.
    We will see that a relational clone corresponds to a certain category, and these ‘coclone theories’ fit in with the formalism of a crowning achievement of the categorical approach to logic. We proceed to describe functorial semantics, to characterise the categories of models, and to consider a number of examples along the way.

    Part II. Abstract coclones, duality.
    A key insight into the structure of the syntactic category of a relational clone provides a basis from which we introduce the notion of ‘abstract coclone’. This leads us to an account of the duality between clones and coclones as a dual equivalence between categories whose objects on each side are certain classes of finite limit theories; the algebraic (Lawvere) theories of the clones are recoverable as certain subcategories thereof.

    This work provides an answer to an invitation extended by editors John Power and Cai Wingfield in the Proceedings of the 2013 Workshop on Algebra, Coalgebra and Topology to obtain a category theoretic treatment of the connection between clones and coclones in terms of Lawvere theories.

  abstract: |-
    The Moore-category on a space X, is an important "homming into X" construction but cannot be classically explained (Moore's domains are not a co-category object in Top). We present an analysis of the Moore construction.

    Suppose T is a finite limit theory, G a T-algebra then elG is a theory called the many sorted theory of T with algebra of sorts G. ElG-algebras correspond (via el left adjoint to Fam) to T-algebras in FamC whose projection onto C is G; similarly elG-coalgebras (co-many-sorted T-algebras) correspond to T-algebras in Fam(C^op). Every T-algebra is trivially an elG-algebra and any elG-algebra K yields a T-algebra F via Kan extension which is given on objects T ∈ T by F(T) = ΣKx x ∈ GT (forget that the G-Indexed sorts are different).

    Moore's domains are a co-many-sorted category in Top, so homming into X gives a many sorted category whose associated ordinary category is the Moore category on X. Similarly the free monoid on a set and the free category on a dirccted graph result from homming out of co-many-sorted monoid and category objects in Set and Grph respectively, and the collection of well formed simplicial complexes form a co-many-sorted ω-category in the category of simplicial sets.

The sources and targets of the n-cube arise as particular "k-blocks in $Λ^n$", where a "0-block" is an element of $Λ^n$, and we inductively define a k-block, k odd (resp. even) is a column (resp. row) of (k-1)-blocks. The sources $\theta_k(n)$, $\tau_k(n)$ of dimensions k of the n-cube can be defined inductively by the maps $\lambda_k, \nu_k, \mu_k : B_n^k \to B_{n + 1}^k, B_{n + 1}^k, B_{n + 1}^{k + 1}$ respectively, where $B_n^k$ is the set of k-blocks in Λ^n.

Kasangian), and 2) On Completeness of Locally-Internal Categories (with R. Betti). Both are to appear in JPAA. In the lecture I gave a brief discussion of the contents. I also suggested that we should produce "Abstracts of the Sydney Category Seminar". There was discussion resulting in general agreement. Michael offered to set this up.

  title: Banach Algebras as Enriched Categorics
  speaker: Barry Jay
  date: 1986-03-05T14:00:00.000Z
  location: Sydney
  abstract: |-
    A normed abelian group $(A, |\ |)$ is an abelian group A together with a monoidal functor $|\ | \colon A \to R^+$ (see Lawvere's Metric Spaces paper) (ie $|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|$, $|0| \leq 0$) satisfying further $|-a| = |a|$. Morphisms of these are norm-reducing group homomorphisms. The category is called Nab. Theorem 1: There is a forgetful fusctor $U : Nab - Met$ (= Metric spaces) which is monadic. Proof: $F(x,d)=(F'X, |\ |)$ where $F'X$ is the free abelian group in X. The norm is generated by $|x-y| = d(xy)$. □ A normed R-algebra is an R-algebra R together with an abelian group norm satisfying $|xy| \leq |x| . |y|$, $|rx| \leq |r| . |x|$ $r \in R$, $|1| \leq 1$. The morphisms are norm-reducing R-algebra homomorphisms; the category is $NR^+$alg. Theorem 2: $NR$-alg → Met is monadic. By cauchy-completing we get the corollary that Banach algebras are monadic over complete metric spaces.

    Some basic facts on $\kappa$-filtered colimits were reviewed. Right $\kappa$-filtered profunctors were introduced, and a number of their properties given. A $\kappa$-accessible category was defined to be a category for which there existed a small set of $\kappa$-presentable objects of which every object was a $\kappa$-filtered colimit.

    Homework: show that every small category with split idempotents is $\kappa$-accessible for some $\kappa$.

    If T is a theory based on the restricted logic, we construct a category $C_T$ whose objects are formulae and whose arrows are (equivalence classes of) n-tuples of terms in the theory. (This is different from the construction of Makkai and Reyes.) $C_T$ is an EM-category and can be used to show that if a sequent is true in all EM-categories which are models of T, then the sequent is a theorem of T (completeness theorem). A proof using Boolean-valued models shows that the classical predicate calculus is a conservative extension of the restricted logic. A relation in an EM-category A is $R \to AB$, where the arrow is in M. A functional relation is one satisfying r(a,b)&r(a,b') b=b' and b r(a,b). There is a category $A_{fr}$, with arrows functional relations, which is regular, and a left exact functor $\Lambda \colon A \to A_{fr}$. Define an object A in an EM-category to be separated if the diagonal $\Delta \colon A \to AA$ is in M and complete if for every functional relation $r : B \to A$ there is a unique morphism $f : B \to A$ such that $\Lambda(f) = r$. Separated (resp. complete) objects enjoy some (but not all) of the properties that separated presheaves (resp. sheaves) have in a category of presheaves.

    A category parametrized by a category C was taken to merely be a functor $\partial \colon A \to C$. Categorical matters to do with limits were claimed to do with cartesian cones in A. The existence of enough cartesian cones includes the fibration condition and completeness of fibres with respect to stable limits. Monics also have to do with limits and so we get a notion of parametric monic in A. This leads to a natural notion of wellpoweredness for parametrized categories.

  abstract: |-
    A tensor product of symmetric monoidal categories. A tensor product of symmetric monoidal categories $A \square B$ is introduced with the universal property strict : $A \square B \to C$ is in bijection with $A \to$ SMon(B, C) where $F = (F, F', F'')$ is strict if F' and F'' are identities and Smon(B,C) is the (symmetric monoidal) category of symmetric monoidal functors from A to C. More formally, there is an adjunction $- \square B$ left adjoint to SMon(B,-): SMon_strict -> SMon. A related adjunction is $- \square' B$ left adjoint to SMon_strongmaps(B, -) : SMon_strict -> SMon_strong. Replacing strict morphisms by strong morphisms we get an equivalence between SMon_strong(A \square' B, C) and SMon_string(A, SMon_strong(B, C)). This $\square'$ gives a monoidal struciure for SMon_strong. A semi-ring is a symmetric monoidal cat V with a strong map $V \square' V \to V$ satisfying the appropriate conditions. Then V may be used to replace $R^+$ in the construction of Banach algebras as in last weeks talk.

    Let A be an EM-category and A an object of A. A power object of A in A is an object PA together with a relation $\epsilon_A : PA \to A$ such that for every relation r : X -> A there is a unique morphism f : X -> PA such that $r = \epsilon_A^\circ\Lambda(f)$. If every object has a power object we call A a near-topos. The full higher-order logic of topoi can be interpreted in a near-topos, every PA is complete (proof uses higher-order logic); the complete objects form a reflective subcategory with left exact reflector and the complete objects form an elementary topos. Examples: (i) Any quasitopos, with (E,M) = (Epis, Strong Monos) (ii) Category of topological spaces, with (Epis, Subspace inclusions) (iii) Elementary topos with topology j; E = composites epi with j-dense mono, M = j-closed monos. Here the complete objects are the j-sheaves, so the result above generalizes the sheafification theorem for elementary topoi.

    What does it mean for a category to have ultra-powers? Paré, Makkai and myself seem to have independently come to the same conclusion that having ultra-powers is part of the axiomatics of a category of models of a theory written in first order logic. Preferably we should be able to state it as a diagonal functor having an adjoint as is the case with having limits and colimits. If X is a set and U is an ultrafilter on X, form a site X as follows: The underlying category is 2^X and the covers of I are finite families {J_i} so that $I = \cup J_i$. Then the characteristic function is a point of the site inducing an adjoint pair p_*, left adjoint to p^* : Shv( X ) -> Set. If we view p_*, as a diagonal; saying p^* exists is saying the U-ultrapower exists. If T is a coherent theory, p_* restricts to Mod(T) -> Mod(T, Shv( X )); but not in theories with negation (eg. the theory of sets with at least two elements). We seem to need Shv( X )/U for this. We loose adjoints in this construction; however perhaps this is the right thing interpreted over a different base topos other than sets, or viewed as a fibred category with a "non-standard" fibration.

  abstract: |-
    Many examples exist of the following phenomenon: a bicategory B (distributive and with further structure), an additive category A, and a "cardinality functor" # : B -> A. The cardinality of a finite set, the dimension of a vector space, the cardinality of a species, all fit into this pattern. I discussed the following important example. Let B be the bicategory whose objects are finite groups, arrows from G to H are finite dimensional left G, right H modules. Let A be the additive category with objects same as B, but arrows from G to H are class functions G $\times$ H -> C. Then the character of a representation provides a cardinality functor. (Which preserves biclosed structure, global tensor product, etc.) The fact that it preserves composition is a fundamental fact not usually stressed in standard books on group representation.

Write A_gpd for the category with the same objects as A and cartesian arrows. Call A wellpowered when each Mon_C(A)_gpd has a terminal object. Say A has small homs when each Hom_C(A,B) has a terminal object. Say A has small idempotency when each Idem_C(A) has a terminal object. Theorems: (i) Wellpowered implies Mon_C(A) is essentially small. (ii) Small homs iff small idempotency.

    (This results from a disscussion with R. Pare while he was in Sydney) If A is any category define T(C)=[C,A] to be the standard parametrization of A. If T is a parametrized category, say T is good if T(f) has both adjoints for all f : C -> D. The standard parametrization is good iff A is complete and cocomplete. If H denotes the homotopy category the we know it is not complete. Heller has introduced an alternative parametrization. For any small category C, we form Top^C. This has a quillen model structure which gives a class of weak equivalences. We invert these and call the result H(C). Theorem (Heller): H is a good parametrization of H. Similarly: If U is a filter on a set X, we can define N(C) for each C by N = Set^C/U (filter-power of Set^C). Theorem: N is a good parametrization of Set^X/U. Both of these, N and H are non-standard parametrizations. Are they part of a general process to make a parametrization good? One feels that for A complete and cocomplete one needn't go beyond the standard parametrization. The standard parametrization of Set^X/U is not good (Adelman–Johnstone).

    Following a previous talk, a new proof is given of the existence of $A \square B$, for symmetric monoidal categories A and B. Proposition 1: SMon(A,SMon(B,C)) $\cong$ SMon(B,SMon(A,C)) 2-naturally in all variables $\square$ Note that by replacing SMon by SMon_strong or SMon_strict ie replace "all monoidal functors B -> C" by "all strong (resp. strict)..." many parallel theorems result. Proposition 2: Let $\alpha$ be a 2-cell in SMon then SMon($\alpha$, -) is defined. Theorem 3: SMon(B,-) : SMon_strict -> SMon has a left 2-adjoint $-\square B$ which is 2-natural in B. Hence $\square$ : SMon^2 -> SMon is a 2-functor. Proposition 4: i: Smon_strict(A $\square$ B,C) -> SMon(A $\square$ B,C) has a right adjoint S. Proof. S is constructed on the gencrators of A $\square$ B given in the previous lecture. Corollary 5: There are 2-natural strict monoidal functors a and a' between (A $\square$ B) $\square$ C and A $\square$ (B $\square$ C) which both satisfy the pentagon law for monoidal categories. Note 1) a and a’ are not inverse. Note 2) Prettier calculations may be made with strong monoidal functors (eg. a becomes an equivalence) but a 'norm' is not strong im general. Note 3) There is a third version of the theorem for bicategorics and homomorphisms. For morphisms of bicategories and homomorphisms. For morphisms of bicategories the naturality conditions break down.

    What follows arises from conversations with A. Kock. Let B be a cartesian closed category and let Vect_R(B) demote the category of R-vector spaces (=modules) in B, where R is a ring in B. The restricted double dual of an object B of B, denoted by D (B) is defined as D (B) = Hom_R(R^B,R) where Hom_R is the object of homomorphisms and R^B has its pointwise vector space structure. Evaluating gives a map k : B -> Hom_R(R^B,B), Now assume that free vector spaces exist, that is, a left adjoint to the forgetful functor Vect_R( B ). The map k above induces a homomorphism h : F(B) -> D (B). We call B linearly finite when h is an isomorphism. If B = Set and R is any field then linear finite is equivalent to finite. This needs decidability to prove. It is even interesting to ask when h is a mono. This situation doesn't cover the motivating example ie. where D (B) is distributions on B, B is a manifold, and the statement that h is an iso is Walbroek's theorem. The problem is we camnot use Vect but some form of complete vector spaces.

    I gave some motivation for my work with Mike Johnson. Our first idea is that one should study paths first and then homotopy. (Following Lavwere) we begin with a topos E. We expect that paths in an object X should have a co-category structure (paths of all dimensions). The first axiom should be that paths are represented. In examples (Sets, simplicial sets, etc.) we find that paths are in fact represented by a family of objects I -> N . The paper we are currently completing deals with the dif- ficult task of defining paths (of all dimensions) in a simplicial set and establishing the $\omega$-category structure on the paths.

    This talk presented an alternative description of Street's orientals. The description is geometric. The elements of the orientals turn out to be certain simplicial sets. A finite n-dimensional simplicial set A is called compatible if for x, y $\in$ X_n, x $\partial_i$; = y $\partial_j$, i+j even, implies x=y. A compatible simplicial set is "sensibly oriented" at its top dimension. To analyze its lower dimensions we define the domain and codomain of a simplicial set. If A is an n-dimensional simplicial set, x $\in$ A is called an end of A if there exists y $\in A_n$, {a_0, a_1, ... a_k } even integers a_0 < a_1 ... < a_k with x = y $\partial_{a_k} \partial_{a_{k - 1}} \cdots \partial_{a_0}$ (composing a la Eilenberg). The graded set of ends of A is denoted by EA). The domain of A is by definition, A-E(A). Similarly for the codomain of A (odd integers). Well formed simplicial sets are defined inductively: A zero dimensional well formed simplicial set is a singleton; an n-dimensional simplicial set is well formed if it's compatible and its domain and codomain are well formed simplicial sets. The collection of well formed simplicial sets form an $\omega$-catecgory (with union as composition).

    Any geometric subject should begin with the correct abstract operations. To begin, we should have a category with finite limits, subobject classifiers, exponentiation. For homotopy theory we should have an object I to parametrize paths; ie paths shoud be a representble functor into $\omega$-categories. The idea is to first study this structure and later study homotopy classes of functions. In fact, work with Michael Johnson has lead to considering many sorted co-$\omega$-category objects (where the sorts form an $\omega$-category) to parametrize paths. The Moore-path category is obtained from a co-category with sorts being real intervals. The free monoid on a set arises from a co-monoid with sorts being natural numbers. In simplicial sets, Street's orientals yield a many-sorted co-$\omega$-category to parametrize paths (Johnson).

    Let M be the endomorphism monoid of 2 in Cat. Then the category of right M-sets is the category of graphs (directed, with chosen endo-edges at each vertex). Let $\omega = \{0,1,2,\dots\}$ as an ordered set. Call $\alpha \colon \omega \to \omega$ in Cat eventually consecutive when there exists $k$ such that $\alpha(i + 1) = \alpha(i) + 1$ for all $i>k$. Let $\Delta$ denote the monoid of eventually constant $\alpha \colon \omega \to \omega$ under composition. The category of right $\Delta$-sets is essentially the category of simplicial sets: there can be some infinite dimension cells. (This was not the main point of the lecture.) The remainder of the lecture described $O_n$, giving some technicalities as to why no loops occur.
